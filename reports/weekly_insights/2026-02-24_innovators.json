She had flagged Nick as an up-and-comer\u2014someone we should consider either for Sequoia itself or for one of our portfolio companies. She also introduced him to the CEO of a cybersecurity company we\u2019d partnered with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That CEO fell in love with Nick immediately and gave me explicit marching orders: \u201cYour mission is to help close Nick.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I happened to be spending a month in New York. Over a few Negronis, I got to know him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What stood out right away was Nick\u2019s intensity\u2014the hunger to achieve. As a McKinsey alum, I was especially impressed that he made engagement manager at the firm in just 18 months by, in his words, \u201chacking the system.\u201d McKinsey is famously time-based, but Nick figured out that early specialization\u2014becoming a true domain expert\u2014was the fastest way to short-circuit the ladder. His trampoline was legal tech, which also turned out to be the preamble to his founder story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, I was very much in pitch mode, trying to recruit him to our cybersecurity portfolio company. Nick\u2019s verdict: \u201cIf I were to take a job, this would be the one. But I really want to try my luck starting my own company.\u201d Fair enough, I thought. And of course, the next best thing to recruiting Nick into a portfolio company was partnering with him on his own entrepreneurial journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first question was simple: \u201cWhat will the company do?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Legal tech,&#8221; he replied. He told me he\u2019d spent his entire McKinsey career serving general counsels and overlooked mid-market in-house legal teams. Nick knew that AI could give these understaffed and overworked teams real leverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s where the serendipity kicked in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2019, before joining Sequoia, I had seriously considered starting a legal tech company myself. I had just left Google, and I was traveling the world, plotting my next move. The idea came from my time at VMware, where it had taken a team of 10 people to manually extract 62 key terms from licensing contracts. That stuck with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started calling GC friends in the Valley and quickly realized: <em>everyone</em> was doing some version of this. Spreadsheets as databases. Manual toil everywhere. The MVP became obvious\u2014use ML to extract key contract terms and populate a searchable system. This was pre-LLMs, but even then it felt doable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had I started that company, it could easily have evolved into Sandstone: an AI-native workflow engine for in-house legal teams. Sandstone learns from a company\u2019s legal intelligence to execute work and simplify business operations, transforming their roles from reactive to strategic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Sequoia, we often talk about the idea of a prepared mind\u2014doing the work on big market shifts before the opportunity shows up. In a sense, I\u2019d been preparing for Sandstone for years. Happily, so had Nick. When he told me his idea, I dusted off my 2019 Product Requirements Document and sent it to him. That may have sealed the deal. <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude42\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/17.0.2/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, legal tech hasn\u2019t been an easy market. But AI has fundamentally changed the dynamics. We\u2019re now seeing multiple legal AI companies scaling quickly, driven by two forces:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Law is the perfect LLM use case\u2014the profession is based on text in, text out.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AI is most powerful when it automates expensive human toil, and few professions rely so heavily on highly trained people doing repetitive work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Sandstone, Sequoia had already partnered with Harvey (AI lawyer), Crosby (AI-enabled law firm), and Ironclad (AI contracting and contract lifecycle management), so we\u2019d seen these dynamics play out firsthand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two months after meeting Nick, we led Sandstone\u2019s pre-seed. Along the way, we got to know his co-founder Jarryd Strydom\u2014another McKinsey alum, and a rare combination of attorney and builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick and Jarryd accelerated from a standing start. They built the MVP in weeks, put it in front of customers immediately, and recruited an outstanding founding team that matches their intensity. The energy in their Brooklyn office is palpable, and it comes from the top. One of my favorite anecdotes: after a dinner together in NYC, we wrapped around 11pm\u2014and both Nick and Jarryd went straight back to the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That speed and execution gave us the conviction to double down and lead Sandstone\u2019s seed round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is just the beginning. Sandstone is well on its way to transforming how legal teams operate and how business gets done.</p>\n</section>\n\n\n<section class=\"social-sharing\">\n\t<div class=\"social-sharing__container\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"social-sharing__title caption caption--16\">Share</h2>\n\t\t<div class=\"social-sharing__options\">\n\t\t\t<button class=\"ico--facebook\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\">\n\t\t\t\tShare this on Facebook\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</button>\n\t\t\t<button class=\"ico--twitter\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\">\n\t\t\t\tShare this on Twitter\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</button>\n\t\t\t<button class=\"ico--linkedin\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\">\n\t\t\t\tShare this on LinkedIn\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</button>\n\t\t\t<a class=\"ico--email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Partnering+with+Sandstone:+An+AI-Native+Platform+for+In-House+Legal+Teams&#038;body=https%3A%2F%2Fsequoiacap.com%2Farticle%2Fpartnering-with-sandstone-an-ai-native-platform-for-in-house-legal-teams%2F\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\">Share this via email</span>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n<div class=\"tags grid\">\n\t<div class=\"grid__instances\">\n\t\t<div class=\"grid__instance\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"tags__container grid__content\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"tags__title caption caption--16\">Related Topics</h2>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"tags__links l-pillbox l-pillbox--centered\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"tag\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/tag/ai/\" style=\"background-color: #fab23a;\">\n\t<span class=\"tag__name tag__name--dark\">#AI</span>\n</a>\n<a class=\"tag\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/tag/funding-announcement/\" style=\"background-color: #fab23a;\">\n\t<span class=\"tag__name tag__name--dark\">#Funding announcement</span>\n</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"grid\">\n\t<div class=\"grid__instances\">\n\t<div class=\"grid__instance\"><div class=\"grid__content\"><a class=\"ink\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-traversal-because-every-engineer-remembers-their-first-time-troubleshooting/?itm_medium=related-content&#038;itm_source=sequoiacap.com\" style=\"background-color: #1b1916;\"><div class=\"ink__content\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"ink__image\" height=\"880\" src=\"https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/06/Ink_Traversal.jpg?w=880&amp;h=880&amp;crop=1\" width=\"880\" />\t<div class=\"ink__text\">\n\t\t\n<h2 class=\"ink__title\">Partnering with Traversal</h2>\n\n\t<div class=\"ink__detail\">By Bogomil Balkansky and Charlie Curnin</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__category ink__category--news\">News</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__cta\">Read</div>\n\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</a></div></div><div class=\"grid__instance\"><div class=\"grid__content\"><a class=\"ink\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-fastapi-labs-simplified-app-deployment/?itm_medium=related-content&#038;itm_source=sequoiacap.com\" style=\"background-color: #1b1916;\"><div class=\"ink__content\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"ink__image\" height=\"880\" src=\"https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/05/Fast-API-Labs_Ink.jpg?w=880&amp;h=880&amp;crop=1\" width=\"880\" />\t<div class=\"ink__text\">\n\t\t\n<h2 class=\"ink__title\">Partnering with FastAPI Labs: Simplified App Deployment </h2>\n\n\t<div class=\"ink__detail\">By Bogomil Balkansky and Lauren Reeder</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__category ink__category--news\">News</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__cta\">Read</div>\n\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</a></div></div><div class=\"grid__instance\"><div class=\"grid__content\"><a class=\"ink\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-apex-security-the-ai-empowered-future-secured/?itm_medium=related-content&#038;itm_source=sequoiacap.com\" style=\"background-color: #1b1916;\"><div class=\"ink__content\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"ink__image\" height=\"880\" src=\"https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Ink_Apex-Portrait.jpg?w=880&amp;h=880&amp;crop=1\" width=\"880\" />\t<div class=\"ink__text\">\n\t\t\n<h2 class=\"ink__title\">Partnering with Apex Security: The AI-Empowered Future, Secured</h2>\n\n\t<div class=\"ink__detail\">By Bogomil Balkansky</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__category ink__category--news\">News</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__cta\">Read</div>\n\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</a></div></div>\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<section class=\"wide-signup grid\">\n\t<div class=\"grid__instances\">\n\t\t<div class=\"grid__instance\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"grid__content grid__content--dark\" style=\"background-color: transparent;\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wide-signup__container\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wide-signup__intro\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJOIN OUR MAILING LIST\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1 class=\"wide-signup__title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet the best stories from the Sequoia community.\t\t\t\t\t</h1>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wide-signup__form\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<!-- Mailchimp for WordPress v4.10.9 -

Fewer tools means easier management and lower costs.</p>\n\n<h2>What is cybersecurity vendor sprawl?</h2>\n\n<p>Same idea. Cybersecurity vendor sprawl is a situation where you have an unnecessary number of cybersecurity vendors when fewer vendors and tools could still cover all of the organization's needs for cybersecurity tool features. More tools from fewer vendors means easier relationship management with vendors and potentially lower costs due to bundling deals.</p>\n\n<h2>What are the negative impacts of tool &amp; vendor sprawl?</h2>\n\n<p>The negative effects of tool and vendor sprawl on costs, productivity, and risk profiles are well documented. But sometimes business leaders don\u2019t understand the full breadth of their potential downsides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Overlapping functionality, unnecessary cost</strong></p>\n\n<p>Multiple tools that fulfill similar use cases are usually an unnecessary cost.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Detection is harder</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Vendor tools don\u2019t share data well, often resulting in missed opportunities to detect and correlate signals.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Too many tools, too many dashboards</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having to log into dozens of tools to analyze issues reduces productivity and increases the risk of missing vital alerts.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Higher integration workload</strong></p>\n\n<p>More tools mean more integration work \u2014 that is, assuming the tools support integration into a centralized dashboard.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Hard to debug and run audits (and run AI)</strong></p>\n\n<p>With more tools, it becomes harder to read and aggregate cybersecurity logs and other data into central locations for fast debugging and auditing, which means longer investigations and more lengthy, expensive audit cycles. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shadow IT creates more attack surfaces</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes tool sprawl is the result of shadow IT. This can sometimes open up more attack surfaces because those tools are not being used with company policies in mind. In a 2020 <a href=\"https://www.cisoplatform.com/profiles/blogs/gartner-predicts-30-of-breaches-due-to-shadow-it-by-2020\">report</a>, Gartner estimated that nearly one-third of all successful cyberattacks come from shadow IT infrastructure. With significant tool sprawl, you've created a virtual shadow IT regardless of whether it was done intentionally or not, because it's extremely hard to have enterprise security visibility over so many tools.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Alert fatigue</strong></p>\n\n<p>The more cybersecurity tools you have, the more alerts you\u2019ll likely get. Many tools are hard to fine-tune so that they don\u2019t produce a litany of false positives.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Too many vendors to potentially contact for support</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vendor sprawl means there are a multitude of vendors to track down and collaborate with when your inevitable support needs arise. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Worse sales deals</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you are buying lots of tools, budgeting and procurement becomes more complex and there are fewer opportunities for volume discounts.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Lost synergy gains</strong></p>\n\n<p>A DIY, custom-integrated cybersecurity toolchain requires more maintenance, and organizations miss out on many of the synergy gains that come from using a suite of tools that work together as a platform out of the box.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Slower incident response</strong></p>\n\n<p>As the number of cybersecurity tools, tests, and interfaces grows, it takes longer to update security policies, implement patches consistently across all environments, and complete threat analyses.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>More maintenance costs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aside from integration maintenance, more tools also mean more maintenance in general. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to start your cybersecurity consolidation initiative</h2>\n\n<p>Tool sprawl is a growing problem, but it\u2019s also a solvable one. With the right strategy, organizations can reduce risk, streamline operations, and unlock real cost savings.</p>\n\n<p>Coming up in <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/how-to-start-consolidating-your-cybersecurity-tools\">part two of this blog</a>, we\u2019ll map out how to get started with cybersecurity toolchain rationalization and vendor consolidation, from aligning key teams to auditing your tooling landscape and identifying high-impact changes.  Stay tuned.</p>\n\n<h2>Real world case studies on consolidation</h2>\n\n<p>Organizational leaders must push their cybersecurity, engineering, and infrastructure operations teams to reduce complexity by centralizing and consolidating on a handful of security platforms rather than a litany of smaller cybersecurity tools.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/roche-s-transition-from-tools-to-platforms-with-terraform-and-vault\">Roche</a> and many other companies run successful cybersecurity product consolidation initiatives, and we\u2019d love to share more insights. We\u2019ve reduced risk for thousands of companies, including <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/case-studies/vodafone-italy\">Vodafone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/case-studies/deutsche-bank\">Deutsche Bank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/case-studies/canva\">Canva</a>, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/on-demand/secure-by-design?utm_source=hashicorp.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=26Q2_WW_BDM_RISK_the-risks-of-cybersecurity-tool-sprawl-why-we-need-consolidation&amp;utm_content=learn-more-conclusion&amp;utm_offer=whitepaper\">Secure by design: How to reduce cloud risk and maintain compliance</a> to learn how we can consolidate the number of Security Lifecycle Management tools you use.</p>\n\n<p><em>Blog last updated: January 12, 2026</em></p>",
