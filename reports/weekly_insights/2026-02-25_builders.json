The arrests came shortly after the FBI and the Dutch police <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/fbi-dutch-police-disrupt-manipulaters-phishing-gang/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seized dozens of servers and domains for the group</a>. Many of those arrested were first publicly identified in a 2021 story here about how they&#8217;d inadvertently infected their computers with malware <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/pakistan-arrests-21-in-heartsender-malware-service/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">that gave away their real-life identities</a>.</p>\n<p>In April, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted the proprietors of a Pakistan-based e-commerce company for conspiring to distribute synthetic opioids in the United States.

Experts blamed that attack on an Internet-of-Things botnet called <strong>Aisuru</strong> that had rapidly grown in size and firepower since its debut in late 2024. Another Aisuru attack on Cloudflare just days later practically doubled the size of the June attack against this website. Not long after that, Aisuru was blamed for a DDoS that again doubled the previous record.</p>\n<p>In October, it appeared the cybercriminals in control of Aisuru had shifted the botnet&#8217;s focus from DDoS to a more sustainable and profitable use: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic</a>.</p>\n<p>However, it has recently become clear that at least some of the disruptive botnet and residential proxy activity attributed to Aisuru last year likely was the work of people responsible for building and testing a powerful botnet known as <strong>Kimwolf</strong>. Chinese security firm <strong>XLab, </strong>which was the first to chronicle Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024,\u00a0<a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/kimwolf-botnet-en/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently profiled Kimwolf</a> as easily the world&#8217;s biggest and most dangerous collection of compromised machines &#8212; with approximately 1.83 million devices under its thumb as of December 17.</p>\n<p>XLab noted that the Kimwolf author &#8220;shows an almost &#8216;obsessive&#8217; fixation on the well-known cybersecurity investigative journalist Brian Krebs, leaving easter eggs related to him in multiple places.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72917\" style=\"width: 759px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-72917\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlabs-littlegossip.png\" width=\"749\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72917\">Image: XLab, Kimwolf Botnet Exposed: The Massive Android Botnet with 1.8 million infected devices.</p></div>\n<p>I am happy to report that the first KrebsOnSecurity stories of 2026 will go deep into the origins of Kimwolf, and examine the botnet&#8217;s unique and highly invasive means of spreading digital disease far and wide. The first in that series will include a somewhat sobering and global security notification concerning the devices and residential proxy services that are inadvertently helping to power Kimwolf&#8217;s rapid growth.</p>\n<p>Thank you once again for your continued readership, encouragement and support.

Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one&#8217;s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.</p>\n<p>The malware that turns one&#8217;s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic &#8212; including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping.</p>\n<p>Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from <strong>IPIDEA</strong>, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">forward malicious commands</a> to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint&#8217;s local network.</p>\n<p>Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf&#8217;s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. These are typically Android Open Source Project devices &#8212; not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices &#8212; and they are generally marketed as a way to watch unlimited (read:pirated) video content from popular subscription streaming services for a one-time fee.</p>\n<p>However, a great many of these TV boxes ship to consumers with residential proxy software pre-installed. What&#8217;s more, they have no real security or authentication built-in: If you can communicate directly with the TV box, you can also easily compromise it with malware.</p>\n<p>While IPIDEA and other affected proxy providers recently have taken steps to block threats like Kimwolf from going upstream into their endpoints (reportedly with varying degrees of success), the Kimwolf malware remains on millions of infected devices.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73086\" style=\"width: 757px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73086\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ipidea2023.png\" width=\"747\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73086\">A screenshot of IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy service.</p></div>\n<p>Kimwolf&#8217;s close association with residential proxy networks and compromised Android TV boxes might suggest we&#8217;d find relatively few infections on corporate networks. However, the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> said a recent review of its customer traffic found <em>nearly 25 percent of them made a query to a Kimwolf-related domain name since October 1, 2025</em>, when the botnet first showed signs of life.</p>\n<p>Infoblox found the affected customers are based all over the world and in a wide range of industry verticals, from education and healthcare to government and finance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be clear, this suggests that nearly 25% of customers had at least one device that was an endpoint in a residential proxy service targeted by Kimwolf operators,&#8221; Infoblox <a href=\"https://www.infoblox.com/blog/threat-intelligence/kimwolf-howls-from-inside-the-enterprise/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a>. &#8220;Such a device, maybe a phone or a laptop, was essentially co-opted by the threat actor to probe the local network for vulnerable devices. A query means a scan was made, not that new devices were compromised.

Synthient said it spied at least 33,000 affected Internet addresses at universities and colleges, and nearly 8,000 IPIDEA proxies within various U.S. and foreign government networks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73093\" style=\"width: 759px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73093\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/top50targetedomains.jpeg\" width=\"749\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73093\">The top 50 domain names sought out by users of IPIDEA&#8217;s residential proxy service, according to Synthient.</p></div>\n<p>In a webinar on January 16, experts at the proxy tracking service <strong>Spur</strong> profiled Internet addresses associated with IPIDEA and 10 other proxy services that were thought to be vulnerable to Kimwolf&#8217;s tricks. Spur found residential proxies in nearly 300 government owned and operated networks, 318 utility companies, 166 healthcare companies or hospitals, and 141 companies in banking and finance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I looked at the 298 [government] owned and operated [networks], and so many of them were DoD [U.S. Department of Defense], which is kind of terrifying that DoD has IPIDEA and these other proxy services located inside of it,&#8221; Spur Co-Founder <strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how these enterprises have these networks set up. It could be that [infected devices] are segregated on the network, that even if you had local access it doesn&#8217;t really mean much. However, it&#8217;s something to be aware of. If a device goes in, anything that device has access to the proxy would have access to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kilmer said Kimwolf demonstrates how a single residential proxy infection can quickly lead to bigger problems for organizations that are harboring unsecured devices behind their firewalls, noting that proxy services present a potentially simple way for attackers to probe other devices on the local network of a targeted organization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you know you have [proxy] infections that are located in a company, you can chose that [network] to come out of and then locally pivot,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;If you have an idea of where to start or look, now you have a foothold in a company or an enterprise based on just that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is the third story in our series on the Kimwolf botnet.

Eight of the vulnerabilities earned Microsoft&#8217;s most-dire &#8220;critical&#8221; rating, and the company warns that attackers are already exploiting one of the bugs fixed today.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-56287 aligncenter\" height=\"521\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png\" width=\"740\" /></p>\n<p>January&#8217;s Microsoft zero-day flaw &#8212; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20805\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-20805</a> &#8212; is brought to us by a flaw in the <strong>Desktop Window Manager</strong> (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user&#8217;s screen. <strong>Kev Breen</strong>, senior director of cyber threat research at <strong>Immersive</strong>, said despite awarding CVE-2026-20805 a middling CVSS score of 5.5, Microsoft has confirmed its active exploitation in the wild, indicating that threat actors are already leveraging this flaw against organizations.</p>\n<p>Breen said vulnerabilities of this kind are commonly used to undermine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Address Space Layout Randomization</a> (ASLR), a core operating system security control designed to protect against buffer overflows and other memory-manipulation exploits.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By revealing where code resides in memory, this vulnerability can be chained with a separate code execution flaw, transforming a complex and unreliable exploit into a practical and repeatable attack,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;Microsoft has not disclosed which additional components may be involved in such an exploit chain, significantly limiting defenders\u2019 ability to proactively threat hunt for related activity. As a result, rapid patching currently remains the only effective mitigation.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Goettl</strong>, vice president of product management at <strong>Ivanti</strong>, observed that CVE-2026-20805 affects all currently supported and extended security update supported versions of the Windows OS. Goettl said it would be a mistake to dismiss the severity of this flaw based on its &#8220;Important&#8221; rating and relatively low CVSS score.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A risk-based prioritization methodology warrants treating this vulnerability as a higher severity than the vendor rating or CVSS score assigned,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Among the critical flaws patched this month are two <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> remote code execution bugs (<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20952\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-20952</a> and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20953\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-20953</a>) that can be triggered just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane.</p>\n<p>Our October 2025 Patch Tuesday <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/patch-tuesday-october-2025-end-of-10-edition/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;End of 10&#8221; roundup</a> noted that Microsoft had removed a modem driver from all versions after it was discovered that hackers were abusing a vulnerability in it to hack into systems. <strong>Adam Barnett</strong> at <strong>Rapid7</strong> said Microsoft today removed another couple of modem drivers from Windows for a broadly similar reason: Microsoft is aware of functional exploit code for an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a very similar modem driver, tracked as <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2023-31096\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-31096</a>.<span id=\"more-73059\"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;That\u2019s not a typo; this vulnerability was originally published via MITRE over two years ago, along with a credible public writeup by the original researcher,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Today\u2019s Windows patches remove agrsm64.sys and agrsm.sys. All three modem drivers were originally developed by the same now-defunct third party, and have been included in Windows for decades. These driver removals will pass unnoticed for most people, but you might find active modems still in a few contexts, including some industrial control systems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Barnett, two questions remain: How many more legacy modem drivers are still present on a fully-patched Windows asset; and how many more elevation-to-SYSTEM vulnerabilities will emerge from them before Microsoft cuts off attackers who have been enjoying &#8220;living off the land[line] by exploiting an entire class of dusty old device drivers?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Although Microsoft doesn\u2019t claim evidence of exploitation for CVE-2023-31096, the relevant 2023 write-up and the 2025 removal of the other Agere modem driver have provided two strong signals for anyone looking for Windows exploits in the meantime,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;In case you were wondering, there is no need to have a modem connected; the mere presence of the driver is enough to render an asset vulnerable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Immersive, Ivanti and Rapid7 all called attention to <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21265\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-21265</a>, which is a critical Security Feature Bypass vulnerability affecting Windows Secure Boot. This security feature is designed to protect against threats like rootkits and bootkits, and it relies on a set of certificates that are set to expire in June 2026 and October 2026. Once these 2011 certificates expire, Windows devices that do not have the new 2023 certificates can no longer receive Secure Boot security fixes.</p>\n<p>Barnett cautioned that when updating the bootloader and BIOS, it is essential to prepare fully ahead of time for the specific OS and BIOS combination you\u2019re working with, since incorrect remediation steps can lead to an unbootable system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fifteen years is a very long time indeed in information security, but the clock is running out on the Microsoft root certificates which have been signing essentially everything in the Secure Boot ecosystem since the days of Stuxnet,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Microsoft issued replacement certificates back in 2023, alongside CVE-2023-24932 which covered relevant Windows patches as well as subsequent steps to remediate the Secure Boot bypass exploited by the BlackLotus bootkit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Goettl noted that <strong>Mozilla</strong>\u00a0has released updates for <strong>Firefox</strong> and <strong>Firefox ESR</strong> resolving a total of 34 vulnerabilities, two of which are suspected to be exploited (CVE-2026-0891 and CVE-2026-0892). Both are resolved in Firefox 147 (MFSA2026-01) and CVE-2026-0891 is resolved in Firefox ESR 140.7 (MFSA2026-03).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Expect <strong>Google Chrome</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> updates this week in addition to a high severity vulnerability in Chrome WebView that was resolved in the January 6 Chrome update (CVE-2026-0628),&#8221; Goettl said.</p>\n<p>As ever, the <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/January%202026%20Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20Summary/32624/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SANS Internet Storm Center</a> has a per-patch breakdown by severity and urgency.
