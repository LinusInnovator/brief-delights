Eight of the vulnerabilities earned Microsoft&#8217;s most-dire &#8220;critical&#8221; rating, and the company warns that attackers are already exploiting one of the bugs fixed today.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-56287 aligncenter\" height=\"521\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png\" width=\"740\" /></p>\n<p>January&#8217;s Microsoft zero-day flaw &#8212; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20805\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-20805</a> &#8212; is brought to us by a flaw in the <strong>Desktop Window Manager</strong> (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user&#8217;s screen. <strong>Kev Breen</strong>, senior director of cyber threat research at <strong>Immersive</strong>, said despite awarding CVE-2026-20805 a middling CVSS score of 5.5, Microsoft has confirmed its active exploitation in the wild, indicating that threat actors are already leveraging this flaw against organizations.</p>\n<p>Breen said vulnerabilities of this kind are commonly used to undermine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Address Space Layout Randomization</a> (ASLR), a core operating system security control designed to protect against buffer overflows and other memory-manipulation exploits.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By revealing where code resides in memory, this vulnerability can be chained with a separate code execution flaw, transforming a complex and unreliable exploit into a practical and repeatable attack,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;Microsoft has not disclosed which additional components may be involved in such an exploit chain, significantly limiting defenders\u2019 ability to proactively threat hunt for related activity. As a result, rapid patching currently remains the only effective mitigation.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Goettl</strong>, vice president of product management at <strong>Ivanti</strong>, observed that CVE-2026-20805 affects all currently supported and extended security update supported versions of the Windows OS. Goettl said it would be a mistake to dismiss the severity of this flaw based on its &#8220;Important&#8221; rating and relatively low CVSS score.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A risk-based prioritization methodology warrants treating this vulnerability as a higher severity than the vendor rating or CVSS score assigned,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Among the critical flaws patched this month are two <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> remote code execution bugs (<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20952\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-20952</a> and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20953\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-20953</a>) that can be triggered just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane.</p>\n<p>Our October 2025 Patch Tuesday <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/patch-tuesday-october-2025-end-of-10-edition/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;End of 10&#8221; roundup</a> noted that Microsoft had removed a modem driver from all versions after it was discovered that hackers were abusing a vulnerability in it to hack into systems. <strong>Adam Barnett</strong> at <strong>Rapid7</strong> said Microsoft today removed another couple of modem drivers from Windows for a broadly similar reason: Microsoft is aware of functional exploit code for an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a very similar modem driver, tracked as <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2023-31096\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-31096</a>.<span id=\"more-73059\"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;That\u2019s not a typo; this vulnerability was originally published via MITRE over two years ago, along with a credible public writeup by the original researcher,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Today\u2019s Windows patches remove agrsm64.sys and agrsm.sys. All three modem drivers were originally developed by the same now-defunct third party, and have been included in Windows for decades. These driver removals will pass unnoticed for most people, but you might find active modems still in a few contexts, including some industrial control systems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Barnett, two questions remain: How many more legacy modem drivers are still present on a fully-patched Windows asset; and how many more elevation-to-SYSTEM vulnerabilities will emerge from them before Microsoft cuts off attackers who have been enjoying &#8220;living off the land[line] by exploiting an entire class of dusty old device drivers?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Although Microsoft doesn\u2019t claim evidence of exploitation for CVE-2023-31096, the relevant 2023 write-up and the 2025 removal of the other Agere modem driver have provided two strong signals for anyone looking for Windows exploits in the meantime,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;In case you were wondering, there is no need to have a modem connected; the mere presence of the driver is enough to render an asset vulnerable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Immersive, Ivanti and Rapid7 all called attention to <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21265\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-21265</a>, which is a critical Security Feature Bypass vulnerability affecting Windows Secure Boot. This security feature is designed to protect against threats like rootkits and bootkits, and it relies on a set of certificates that are set to expire in June 2026 and October 2026. Once these 2011 certificates expire, Windows devices that do not have the new 2023 certificates can no longer receive Secure Boot security fixes.</p>\n<p>Barnett cautioned that when updating the bootloader and BIOS, it is essential to prepare fully ahead of time for the specific OS and BIOS combination you\u2019re working with, since incorrect remediation steps can lead to an unbootable system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fifteen years is a very long time indeed in information security, but the clock is running out on the Microsoft root certificates which have been signing essentially everything in the Secure Boot ecosystem since the days of Stuxnet,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Microsoft issued replacement certificates back in 2023, alongside CVE-2023-24932 which covered relevant Windows patches as well as subsequent steps to remediate the Secure Boot bypass exploited by the BlackLotus bootkit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Goettl noted that <strong>Mozilla</strong>\u00a0has released updates for <strong>Firefox</strong> and <strong>Firefox ESR</strong> resolving a total of 34 vulnerabilities, two of which are suspected to be exploited (CVE-2026-0891 and CVE-2026-0892). Both are resolved in Firefox 147 (MFSA2026-01) and CVE-2026-0891 is resolved in Firefox ESR 140.7 (MFSA2026-03).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Expect <strong>Google Chrome</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> updates this week in addition to a high severity vulnerability in Chrome WebView that was resolved in the January 6 Chrome update (CVE-2026-0628),&#8221; Goettl said.</p>\n<p>As ever, the <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/January%202026%20Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20Summary/32624/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SANS Internet Storm Center</a> has a per-patch breakdown by severity and urgency.

These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.\n  To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval.
