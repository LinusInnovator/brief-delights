Non-human identities (NHIs) \u2014 service accounts, API keys, OAuth tokens, certificates, and machine credentials \u2014 now vastly outnumber human users in most organizations, yet we're still managing them with approaches designed for people.</p>\n\n<h2>The NHI problem: Static secrets at scale</h2>\n\n<p>The explosion of microservices, containerized workloads, and cloud-native architecture has created an <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/the-unseen-risk-securing-nhis-in-your-infrastructure\">NHI crisis</a>. A typical Kubernetes cluster might contain hundreds of pods, each requiring credentials to access:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Databases</li>\n<li>Message queues</li>\n<li>Object storage</li>\n<li>External APIs, etc. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Multiply this across development, staging, and production environments, then add: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CI/CD pipelines</li>\n<li>Monitoring agents</li>\n<li>Backup services</li>\n<li>Infrastructure automation tools, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At this point, you're managing thousands or tens of thousands of non-human identities.</p>\n\n<p>Static secrets are the Achilles' heel of this architecture. This could be\u2026 </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A database password embedded in an environment variable</li>\n<li>The AWS access key in your Terraform state file</li>\n<li>The service account JSON sitting in a mounted volume</li>\n<li>And countless other things</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These long-lived credentials represent <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/why-we-need-short-lived-credentials-and-how-to-adopt-them\">persistent attack surfaces</a>. When a static secret is compromised, attackers gain access until someone manually rotates it, assuming the breach is even detected. The <a href=\"https://circleci.com/blog/jan-4-2023-incident-report/\">CircleCI breach of 2023</a> is a classic example, where compromised OAuth tokens and credentials stored in their systems gave attackers potential access to thousands of customer environments.</p>\n\n<p>The operational burden is equally problematic. Manual credential rotation is error-prone and rarely happens on schedule. Tracking where secrets are used becomes impossible as infrastructure scales. When you need to revoke access, can you confidently identify every location where a particular API key or certificate is deployed? The answer in most organizations is \u201cno,\u201d leading to the accumulation of zombie credentials that persist indefinitely because teams are worried about breaking unknown dependencies.</p>\n\n<h2>Passwordless authentication for humans: Setting the foundation</h2>\n\n<p>Before diving into a deeper discussion of NHI solutions, it's worth noting that human identity management is also evolving rapidly. Technologies like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn\">WebAuthn</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO_Alliance#FIDO2\">FIDO2</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.passkeys.com/what-are-passkeys\">passkeys</a> are eliminating passwords for end users, using public-key cryptography and biometric authentication to provide phishing-resistant authentication. While this represents significant progress for human users, the more complex challenge lies in securing the non-human authentication that powers modern infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h2>Workload identity: Eliminating static secrets for NHIs</h2>\n\n<p>The most promising development in NHI management is the shift toward <em>workload identity</em>: treating non-human identities as first-class citizens with dynamically issued, short-lived credentials. Rather than distributing and managing static secrets, workload identity systems leverage the infrastructure itself to establish identity and issue temporary credentials.</p>\n\n<p>Cloud providers have led this evolution. AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA), Azure Managed Identities, and Google Cloud Workload Identity allow workloads to authenticate based on their execution context rather than embedded secrets. A pod running in Kubernetes can assume an IAM role and receive temporary credentials that expire in minutes or hours, never requiring a static access key to be stored anywhere. The infrastructure attests to the workload's identity, and credentials are vended just-in-time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/service-mesh\">Service meshes</a> extend this concept to service-to-service communication, automatically issuing and rotating<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/system/files/inline-files/An_Overview_of_x.509_certificates.pdf\"> X.509 certificates</a> through<a href=\"https://spiffe.io/\"> SPIFFE/SPIRE</a> implementations. Every service gets a cryptographically verifiable identity, and mutual TLS happens transparently without developers managing certificates. When implemented properly, no service ever needs to handle a long-lived secret.</p>\n\n<p>The practical implications are significant: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your CI/CD pipeline authenticates to your cloud provider using <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nitesh_17214/the-future-of-identity-openid-connect-federation-1-0-c5ed937bbd40\">OIDC federation</a>, receiving temporary credentials scoped to exactly what that pipeline run needs. </li>\n<li>Your application pods never see database passwords. They authenticate using their workload identity and receive time-limited access tokens. </li>\n<li>When you decommission a service, its identity disappears with it, automatically revoking access without manual cleanup.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Secrets management for the transition period</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the promise of workload identity, <em>complete elimination</em> of static secrets remains aspirational for most organizations. </p>\n\n<p>The reality is that most organizations use legacy systems, third-party SaaS APIs, and databases that don't support <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/why-we-need-dynamic-secrets\">dynamic credentials</a>. This means having to manage some static secrets for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n<p>The question is how to do it safely.</p>\n\n<p>Modern secrets management has evolved from simple encrypted key-value stores to platforms that enforce least-privilege access and automate rotation. <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_future-of-secrets-identity-mgmt-blog_PRODUCTPAGE&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=product_page\">HashiCorp Vault</a> pioneered many of these patterns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic secrets generation for databases and cloud providers</li>\n<li>Leasing and renewal mechanisms</li>\n<li>Detailed audit logging, etc. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Vault can also easily integrate with cloud-native secret managers like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Google Secret Manager for more centralized visibility and control in a multi-cloud environment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The critical capabilities for contemporary secrets management include:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automated rotation with rollback capabilities</li>\n<li>Just-in-time access provisioning where secrets are injected at runtime rather than stored in configuration</li>\n<li>Policy-based access control that restricts which workloads can access which secrets</li>\n<li>Comprehensive audit trails showing exactly when and by whom secrets were accessed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Integration with CI/CD pipelines is also essential. Secrets should be pulled during deployment and injected as environment variables or mounted volumes, <em>never</em> committed to repositories or stored in pipeline definitions.</p>\n\n<p>For organizations still distributing secrets manually or storing them in configuration management systems, the path forward involves: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/on-demand/12-things-a-modern-secrets-management-solution-must-do?utm_source=hashicorp.com&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_future-of-secrets-identity-mgmt-blog_WHITEPAPER&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=whitepaper\">Consolidating secrets</a> into a dedicated management platform</li>\n<li>Automating injection into workloads</li>\n<li>Implementing <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/rotated-vs-dynamic-secrets-which-should-you-use\">rotation policies</a></li>\n<li>Progressively migrating to dynamic credentials where possible</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a multi-year journey for most organizations, so it\u2019s important to adopt a realistic perspective, which means accepting that you'll operate in a hybrid state for some time.</p>\n\n<h2>Zero trust architecture: Continuous verification for NHIs</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/introduction-to-zero-trust-security\">Zero trust principles</a> apply as much to NHIs as to human users. The castle-and-moat model of &quot;authenticate once at the perimeter and trust thereafter&quot; has proven inadequate in environments where lateral movement and privilege escalation are primary attack vectors. For NHIs, zero trust means <strong>continuous validation of identity, context, and authorization</strong> throughout a request lifecycle.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/policies\">Policy engines</a> and cloud-native authorization services enable fine-grained, context-aware access control. Rather than binary &quot;can this service account access this resource&quot; decisions, policies can incorporate factors like: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Requesting a workload's namespace</li>\n<li>Time of day</li>\n<li>Sensitivity of the requested data</li>\n<li>Security posture of the underlying infrastructure</li>\n<li>and more</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A database query from a production namespace might be allowed, while the identical query from a developer's laptop is denied.</p>\n\n<p>Implementing zero trust for NHIs requires infrastructure that can continuously verify workload identity and provide contextual mapping to policy engines. Service meshes excel here, embedding identity and policy enforcement directly in the data path. Every request carries verifiable identity information, and authorization decisions happen at microsecond latency, making fine-grained control practical even in high-throughput environments.</p>\n\n<h2>Observability and detection: Knowing your blast radius</h2>\n\n<p>You can't secure what you can't see. One of the most significant challenges in NHI management is simply maintaining an inventory of NHIs and understanding their access patterns. Most organizations discover they have far more service accounts, API keys, and machine credentials than they realized when they attempt comprehensive enumeration.</p>\n\n<p>Modern credential management requires continuous discovery and monitoring. This means having tools that <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault/hcp-vault-radar?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_afuture-of-secrets-identity-mgmt-blog_PRODUCTPAGE&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=product_page\">scan repositories for leaked secrets</a> and tools that can <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/products/verify-identity-protection\">inventory cloud IAM roles and service accounts</a>. These platforms discover hidden API keys, passwords, and machine identities across entire infrastructures, enabling organizations to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Map dependencies between services and credentials</li>\n<li>Identify migration candidates ready for managed identity transformation</li>\n<li>Assess risks associated with current secret usage and triage exposed secrets</li>\n<li>Plan strategic migrations rather than blind transformations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Detection of anomalous NHI behavior is equally critical. It\u2019s important to be able to identify unusual activity, such as: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A service account accessing resources outside its typical scope</li>\n<li>Authentication from unexpected network locations</li>\n<li>Sudden spikes in API usage, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unlike human behavior, machine workloads tend to be highly predictable, making anomaly detection particularly effective for NHIs. For example, if your batch processing service starts making database queries at noon instead of 2 a.m., or your CI/CD service account suddenly accesses production resources, these represent unusual activities worth investigating.</p>\n\n<h2>The road ahead: Practical steps for technical leaders</h2>\n\n<p>The transformation from static secrets to workload identity represents a multi-year journey that requires coordinated effort across development, operations, and security teams. For technical decision makers charting this path, several strategic priorities emerge.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Establish workload identity as the default for new services.</strong> Cloud-native workloads should leverage native identity services from day one rather than falling back to static credentials out of familiarity or perceived simplicity. The initial investment in understanding IAM roles, service accounts, and OIDC federation pays dividends immediately and avoids accumulating technical debt that must be remediated later.</li>\n<li><strong>Implement <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/5-best-practices-for-secrets-management\">comprehensive secrets management</a> for existing static credentials.</strong> Consolidating secrets into a centralized platform with automated rotation and access policies provides immediate security benefits and brings visibility into your secret footprint, helping you to prioritize which systems to migrate to dynamic credentials.</li>\n<li><strong>Make <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/what-are-non-human-identities-nhi-and-who-owns-their-security\">NHI governance</a> a priority.</strong> Implement processes for provisioning, reviewing, and decommissioning non-human identities with the same discipline applied to human accounts. Periodic access reviews should include service accounts and API keys, not just user permissions. Automated discovery and inventory management should feed into your security operations, providing visibility into the true scope of your NHI footprint.</li>\n<li><strong>Invest in observability for NHI behavior.</strong> Understanding normal patterns enables anomaly detection. Comprehensive audit logging of credential usage provides both security monitoring and compliance evidence. The ability to answer &quot;which services accessed this resource and when&quot; is foundational to incident response and forensics.</li>\n<li><strong>Embrace federation and standards.</strong> OIDC, OAuth 2.0, SPIFFE, and other open standards enable interoperability and reduce vendor lock-in. As identity moves increasingly toward distributed, heterogeneous environments spanning multiple clouds and on-premises infrastructure, standards-based approaches will be essential to maintaining consistent security policies.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The future of credential and identity management for NHIs is going to require automation, discovery, and visibility. Organizations that lead us into this future will make workload identity the default. Their secrets will rotate themselves, and when policy enforcement happens transparently in the infrastructure layer, security will stop being a manual process prone to human error. Gradually, security will become a property of the architecture itself.</p>\n\n<p>That future is achievable today for new cloud native workloads, and it represents the target state for existing infrastructure. The important point for technical leaders to understand is that this evolution won\u2019t be done in isolation. Secrets management, identity management, secure access \u2014 these all need to become threads in the larger fabric of a <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/infrastructure-cloud?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_future-of-secrets-identity-mgmt-blog_WEBSITE&amp;utm_content=conclusion-cta&amp;utm_offer=website\">unified platform</a>, tying together the software delivery pipeline from CI/CD, to infrastructure provisioning, to workload orchestration. </p>",

      "raw_content": "<p>The mandate to leverage data and AI for operational gain is forcing businesses to reckon with growing complexity in their IT infrastructure. As a result, leaders are now asking: What is hybrid cloud, and what role will it play in our company\u2019s future?</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, companies rely on a mix of public and private cloud infrastructure services, as well as systems they own and operate themselves. Done right, this hybrid architecture lets organizations connect on-premises solutions that still support mission-critical workflows to the growing number of cloud-based systems, while also enabling quicker and more seamless access to AI, edge computing, and other frontier technology \u2014 all while maintaining strong, consistent security across the entire IT landscape.</p>\n\n<p>But many struggle to achieve these benefits. For 52% of businesses, hybrid cloud is a top infrastructure management challenge, according to the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/cloud-complexity-report?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_BDM_MULTI_hybrid-cloud-explained-blog&amp;utm_content=intro-blog-link&amp;utm_offer=ccr\">2025 Cloud Complexity Survey</a>. Often, cloud and on-premises systems aren't connected. They\u2019re typically managed in silos, creating gaps that slow down developers, increase risk, and lead to unexpected costs. Security and infrastructure specialists don\u2019t communicate as much as they should. And instead of AI-driven automation, platform teams and developers continue to do much of their work manually.</p>\n\n<p>Without a unified lifecycle approach to hybrid cloud management, enterprises could find themselves falling short in their data and AI priorities in 2026. However, when infrastructure is managed through one control plane as a single architecture, infrastructure becomes a catalyst for faster, more impactful innovation.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll outline what\u2019s needed for an effective hybrid cloud strategy, and explain how a unified lifecycle approach can accelerate, strengthen, and optimize infrastructure management.</p>\n\n<h2>Building the right hybrid cloud</h2>\n\n<p>The hybrid model is quickly becoming a common architecture choice. In fact, by 2027, an estimated 90% of organizations will use a hybrid cloud, <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-11-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-total-723-billion-dollars-in-2025\">according to Gartner</a>. Why is it becoming popular?</p>\n\n<h3>Why is a hybrid cloud important?</h3>\n\n<p>On-premises systems often hold some of a company\u2019s most valuable data, and play a pivotal role in core workflows \u2014 particularly for regulated industries that must protect sensitive and confidential information. Some companies will find it safer or less expensive to keep some data managed in house and on-prem. But that data will also become key context for AI in the coming months and years. Now, as more enterprises aim to use AI to automate processes and improve deduction-making, among other outcomes, it\u2019s imperative that businesses minimize gaps between their on-prem and cloud technology.</p>\n\n<h3>Hybrid cloud vs. multi-cloud</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Hybrid cloud</strong> is defined as any infrastructure that uses both cloud (regardless of whether it\u2019s public and/or private) and on-premises dedicated datacenters. <strong>Multi-cloud</strong> is defined as any infrastructure that uses more than one cloud vendor or system (regardless of whether it\u2019s public and/or private, self-built, or from a third-party). Organizations can have both hybrid cloud and multi-cloud infrastructure simultaneously, which is not uncommon.</p>\n\n<p>The hybrid cloud management challenge is similar to the multi-cloud management challenge. Siloed teams and workflows cause massive levels of friction when new software innovations need to harness multiple environments, and companies need to secure and manage all those environments efficiently.</p>\n\n<h3>Why hybrid cloud requires a unified lifecycle approach to infrastructure</h3>\n\n<p>Organizations with hybrid cloud environments understand how challenging this infrastructure can be. Adrian Cockcroft, who once led the open source program at Netflix, compared hybrid cloud management to one rider riding two horses.</p>\n\n<p>Teams that want to start addressing runaway infrastructure costs and growing inefficiency need to focus on that \u201cone rider\u201d as the key leverage point for fixing their problems. To do that, organizations need to build a <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/infrastructure-cloud?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_BDM_SPEED_hybrid-cloud-explained-blog_WEBSITE&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=website\">unified platform</a> as a foundation that will allow software teams to \u201cride multiple horses\u201d without noticing a difference in speed or process friction.</p>\n\n<p>A unified lifecycle approach to security and infrastructure management that eliminates barriers across hybrid infrastructure requires several components, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An infrastructure as code approach to infrastructure and policy to deliver consistency across environments</li>\n<li>Self-service provisioning to remove complexity for developers</li>\n<li>Identity-based access, with centralized secrets management to shift the business from long-lived to short-lived credentials, API keys, and other sensitive secrets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Doing hybrid cloud right</h2>\n\n<p>Hybrid cloud complexity is more than an IT problem; it can drag down the whole business.</p>\n\n<p>Without a unified view across the entire infrastructure landscape, it\u2019s harder and more time-consuming for platform teams to spot vulnerabilities or troubleshoot issues, leading to higher costs and worse performance. Similarly, without standardized policies and processes, developers take an ad hoc approach to building software that leads to an exploding number of security gaps and reliability issues.</p>\n\n<p>A unified lifecycle approach to hybrid cloud management transforms how platform teams operate to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Accelerate innovation - by removing manual, time-consuming aspects of infrastructure management and provisioning.</li>\n<li>Strengthen security - with an identity-based zero trust operating model, spanning an organization\u2019s human and non-human entities.</li>\n<li>Optimize spend - with real-time visibility and cost controls to proactively detect issues before they lead to larger monthly bills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n\n<p>To learn more about how we can help your company navigate the complexities of hybrid infrastructure for more secure, automated operations, check out our new <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/do-cloud-right-explained?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_BDM_MULTI_hybrid-cloud-explained-blog_WEBSITE&amp;utm_content=end-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=website\"><em>Do Cloud Right, Explained</em></a> video series and <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/contact-sales?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=26Q3_WW_PRACTITIONER_RISK_rethinking-ssh-blog_CONTACTSALES&amp;utm_content=end-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=contactsales\">drop us a line</a> to talk about your unique IT challenges.</p>",

It's the same exhilaration we get from roller coasters, but when you're in the driver's seat, you're in charge of the ride.</p>\n<p>When you're not expecting it, though, there's anxiety instead of excitement and, should the slide end with a crunch, a lot more negative emotions, too.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, fewer and fewer drivers will have to experience that kind of scare thanks to the proliferation and sophistication of modern electronic stability and traction control systems.

But let&#x2019;s consider&#xa0;how this email even got sent to its target in the first place:</p><ul><li>An attacker slurped up lists of any public emails of 2008 political campaign staffers.</li><li>One 2008 staffer was&#xa0;<em>also</em>&#xa0;hired for the 2016 political campaign.</li><li>That particular staffer had non-public campaign emails in their address book, and one of them was a powerful key campaign member with an extensive email history.</li></ul><p>On successful phish leads to an even wider address book attack net down the line. Once they gain access to a person&#x2019;s inbox, they use it to prepare to their next attack. They&#x2019;ll harvest existing email addresses, subject lines, content, and attachments to construct plausible looking boobytrapped emails and mail them to all of&#xa0;<em>their</em>&#xa0;contacts. How sophisticated and targeted to a particular person this effort is determines whether it&#x2019;s so-called &#x201c;spear&#x201d; phishing or not.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"742\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/phishing-vs-spear-phishing.png\" width=\"1972\" /></figure><p>In this case is it was not at all targeted. This is a remarkably unsophisticated, absolutely generic routine phishing attack. There is zero focused attack effort on display here. But note the target did&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;immediately click the link in the email!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"989\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-hack-email-link-1.png\" width=\"1696\" /></figure><p>Instead, he did exactly what you&#x2019;d want a person to do in this scenario:&#xa0;<strong>he emailed IT support and asked if this email was valid.</strong>&#xa0;But IT made&#xa0;a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fatal mistake in their response</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-it-support-response.png\" width=\"1212\" /></figure><p>Do you see it? Here&#x2019;s the kicker:</p><blockquote>Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said&#xa0;<strong>he had meant to type that it was an &#x201c;illegitimate&#x201d; email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.</strong></blockquote><p>One word. He got&#xa0;<em>one</em>&#xa0;word wrong. But what a word to get wrong, and in the first sentence! The email did provide the proper Google address to reset your password. But the lede was already buried since the first sentence said &#x201c;legitimate;&#x201d; the phishing link in that email was then clicked. And the rest is literally history.</p><p>What&#x2019;s even funnier (well, in the way of gallows humor, I guess) is that public stats were left enabled for that bit.ly tracking link, so you can see exactly what crazy domain that &#x201c;Google login page&#x201d; resolved to, and that it was clicked exactly twice, on the same day it was mailed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"715\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/bitly-podesta-tracking-link.png\" width=\"1120\" /></figure><p>As I said, these were not exactly sophisticated attackers. So yeah, in&#xa0;<em>theory</em>&#xa0;an attentive user could pay attention to the browser&#x2019;s address bar and notice that after clicking the link, they arrived at</p><p><code>http://myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk/security/signinoptions/password</code></p><p>instead of</p><p><code>https://myaccount.google.com/security</code></p><p>Note that the phishing URL is carefully constructed so the most &#x201c;correct&#x201d; part is at the front, and weirdness is sandwiched in the middle. Unless you&#x2019;re paying very close attention and your address bar is long enough to expose the full URL, it&#x2019;s&#x2026; tricky. See this 10 second video for a dramatic example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular\">\n            <div class=\"kg-video-container\">\n                <video height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://img.spacergif.org/v1/1920x1080/0a/spacer.png\" preload=\"metadata\" src=\"https://storage.ghost.io/c/eb/aa/ebaa2665-01a8-4415-8825-69d1f0e8fd19/content/media/2025/02/twitter-phishing-video.mp4\" width=\"1920\"></video>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-overlay\">\n                    <button class=\"kg-video-large-play-icon\">\n                        <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                            <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\">\n                        </svg>\n                    </button>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-player-container\">\n                    <div class=\"kg-video-player\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-play-icon\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                                <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                                <rect height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\" width=\"7\" x=\"3\" y=\"1\">\n                                <rect height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\" width=\"7\" x=\"14\" y=\"1\">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <span class=\"kg-video-current-time\">0:00</span>\n                        <div class=\"kg-video-time\">\n                            /<span class=\"kg-video-duration\">0:10</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <input class=\"kg-video-seek-slider\" max=\"100\" type=\"range\" value=\"0\" />\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-playback-rate\">1&#xd7;</button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-unmute-icon\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                                <path d=\"M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z\">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                                <path d=\"M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z\">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <input class=\"kg-video-volume-slider\" max=\"100\" type=\"range\" value=\"100\" />\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n        </figure><p>(<s>And if you think that one&#x2019;s good, check out&#xa0;this one.</s> Don&#x2019;t forget all the Unicode look-alike trickery you can pull, too.) </p><p>I originally wrote this post as a presentation for the Berkeley Computer Science Club back in March, and at that time I gathered a list of public phishing pages I found on the web.</p><p><code>nightlifesofl.com<br />ehizaza-limited.com<br />tcgoogle.com<br />appsgoogie.com<br />security-facabook.com</code></p><p>Of those five examples from 6 months ago, one is completely gone, one loads just fine, and three present an appropriately scary red interstitial warning page that strongly advises you not to visit the page you&#x2019;re trying to visit, courtesy of Google&#x2019;s&#xa0;<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">safe browsing API</a>.

Security awareness even followed the campaigners into the bathroom, where someone put a picture of a toothbrush under the words: &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t share your passwords either.&#x201d;</blockquote><p>The campaign itself used two factor auth extensively, which is why personal Gmail accounts were targeted, because they were less protected.</p><p>The key takeaway here is that&#xa0;<strong>it&#x2019;s basically impossible, statistically speaking, to prevent your organization from being phished.</strong></p><p>Or is it?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-32.png\" width=\"440\" /></figure><p>Nobody is doing better work in this space right now than Maciej Ceglowski and Tech Solidarity.

These three short sentences are the 60 second summary of what you want to do, and what you want to share with others so&#xa0;<em>they</em>&#xa0;do, too.</p><p><strong>1) Enable Two Factor authentication through an app, and&#xa0;<em>not SMS</em>, everywhere you can.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"481\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/google-2fa-1.png\" width=\"566\" /></figure><p>Logging in with only a password, now matter how long and unique you attempt to make that password, will never be enough. A password is what you know; you need to add the second factor of something you&#xa0;<em>have</em>&#xa0;(or something you&#xa0;<em>are</em>) to achieve significant additional security. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SMS can famously&#xa0;be intercepted</a>, social engineered, or sim-jacked all too easily. If it&#x2019;s SMS, it&#x2019;s not secure,&#xa0;<em>period</em>. So install an authenticator app, and use it, at least for your most important credentials such as your email account and your bank.</p><p>Have I mentioned that Discourse&#xa0;added <a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2018/05/discourse-2-0-released/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two factor authentication support</a> in version 2.0, and our just released 2.1 adds printed backup codes, too? There are two paths forward: you can&#xa0;<em>talk</em>&#xa0;about the solution, or you can&#xa0;<em>build</em>&#xa0;the solution. I&#x2019;m trying to do both to the best of my ability. Look for the 2FA auth option in your user preferences on your favorite Discourse instance. It&#x2019;s there for you.</p><p>(This is also a company policy at Discourse; if you work here,&#xa0;<em>you 2FA everything all the time</em>. No other login option exists.)</p><p><strong>2) Make all your passwords 11 characters or more.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/hacker-hack-thyself/\">a long story</a>, but anything under 11 characters&#xa0;is basically the <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-password-is-too-damn-short/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">same as having no password</a> at all&#xa0;these days. I personally recommend at least 14 characters, maybe even 16. But this won&#x2019;t be a problem for you, because...</p><p><strong>3) Use a password manager.</strong></p><p>If you use a password manager, you can simultaneously avoid the pernicious danger of password re-use and&#xa0;the difficulty of coming up with <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/\">unique and random passwords</a>&#xa0;all the time. It is my hope in the long run that cloud based password management gets deeply built into Android, iOS, OSX, and Windows so that people don&#x2019;t need to run a weird m&#xe9;lange of third party apps to achieve this essential task. Password management is foundational and should not be the province of third parties on principle, because you never outsource a core competency.</p><p><strong>Bonus rule! For the particularly at-risk, get and use a U2F key.</strong></p><p>In the long term, two factor through an app isn&#x2019;t quite secure enough due to the very real (and growing) specter of real-time phishing. Authentication apps offer timed keys that expire after a minute or two, but if the attacker can get you to type an authentication key and relay it to the target site fast enough, they can still log in as you. If you need ultimate protection,&#xa0;look into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U2F keys</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/u2f-keys.jpg\" width=\"720\" /></figure><p>I believe U2F support is still too immature at the moment, particularly on mobile, for this to be practical for the average person right now. But if you do happen to fall into those groups that will be under attack, you&#xa0;<em>absolutely</em>&#xa0;want to set up U2F keys where you can today. They&#x2019;re cheap, and the good news is that they&#xa0;<em>literally make phishing impossible</em>&#xa0;at last. Given that Google had&#xa0;100% company-wide <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">success against phishing with U2F</a>, we know this works.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s world, computers are now so omnipresent that there is no longer any such thing as cybersecurity, online security, or computer security &#x2013; there&#x2019;s only&#xa0;<em>security</em>. You either have it, or you don&#x2019;t. If you follow and share these three rules, hopefully you too can have a modicum of security today.</p>",
