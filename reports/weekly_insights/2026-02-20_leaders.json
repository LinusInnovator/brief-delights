Every cloud provider was configured differently. And we have about 30 years of one-offs.\u201d\u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So how did GEICO finally set itself on a path to do cloud right and build the right foundation for AI? </p>\n\n<p>This post, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKd5j6A7Nt0\">based on a talk from HashiConf</a>, outlines the important hybrid cloud management lessons GEICO learned and how HashiCorp Vault played a major role in building its new infrastructure platform. </p>\n\n<h2>Stop securing the network, start securing identity</h2>\n\n<p>GEICO\u2019s Rebecca Weekly (VP, Infrastructure Engineering) and Ammar Zuberi (Distinguished Engineer, Infrastructure) explained one of their teams\u2019 first observations: many of their woes were a result of their legacy, network-centric security model.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, GEICO \u2014 like many enterprises \u2014 used the network to enforce security. Firewalls, VLANs, and point-to-point rules dictated who could access what. That approach worked when infrastructure was static. It breaks down fast in hybrid and multi-cloud environments.</p>\n\n<p>Using the network as a comprehensive security perimeter created fragility, slow change cycles, and security blind spots. There was no single end-to-end view of access or posture, and every change required coordination across teams and vendors.</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>Their solution</u></strong>: move security up the stack and enforce policy as close to users and workloads as possible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe decided that the network only has to do one job, which is move packets from point A to point B. We should do security at higher layers in our network, so we decided that we're going to make our network as simple as possible.\u201d\u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They started to shift away from their legacy network security model and adopted a new approach that involves:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Enforcing policy at the platform and workload layers, tied to identity</li>\n<li>Certificates and identity from an IdP, enabling their new identity-first security approach</li>\n<li>Segmenting traffic at the workload level instead of the network level</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;We could move these security requirements into the platform layers where you could get much more granular about what policies you were allowing and what kind of access was allowed. ... As far as security goes, as a workload owner, you're optimizing for a business process. You don't need to care as much about security.&quot; \u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMake your policy as close to your user or your workload as possible. That is the only way to scale. Period. Full stop.\u201d \u2014 Rebecca Weekly, VP, Infrastructure Engineering, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not only did this shift modernize their security posture, it also made the network more reliable and the workload deployment experience much better.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Centralize identity and secrets to regain control</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Once GEICO stopped relying on the network for security, identity became the control plane.</p>\n\n<p>That meant rethinking how secrets, certificates, and workload identities were created, distributed, and governed across a sprawling hybrid cloud environment.</p>\n\n<p>Before this shift:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Certificates were often handled manually</li>\n<li>There was no consistent certificate management strategy</li>\n<li>Access <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/the-pain-points-of-vpns-in-enterprise-it\">through a VPN</a> was broad and tied to network location rather than identity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_TDM_RISK_geico-blog_PRODUCTPAGE&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=product_page\">HashiCorp Vault</a> became a keystone of GEICO's new security model, providing an organizationally consistent way to manage secrets and identities across on-prem and multi-cloud environments.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe use workload identities, certificates, things like that that we got out of HashiCorp Vault to centralize authentication, policy enforcement, and the management of those secrets.\u201d\u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just as importantly, Vault brought standardization to their security practices.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt forced us to standardize our access policies into a single place where we could actually reason about them.\u201d\u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Build vs. buy</h2>\n\n<p>GEICO started its Vault adoption with Vault community edition, but quickly realized that spending time building more features on top of that, which they needed to meet regulations, was going to involve too much time and money spent on features that didn\u2019t differentiate their business:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c'We're going to build it all ourselves. We can do everything.' And then what we found in the process was that there were requirements for auditors in different domains that we could have built, but it probably would have taken us N months, and we needed to be compliant today. And that was really the outcome around controlling our own destiny and making the right decisions for us as a business. So we made the decision to move forward with HashiCorp\u2019s version of Vault, and that allowed us to get these features out of the box versus having to build them for ourselves.\u201d \u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These out-of-the-box features that GEICO needed included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated FIPS compliance</li>\n<li>Multi-region, high-availability Vault cluster replication</li>\n<li>Automated snapshots for disaster recovery</li>\n<li>Namespace and tenant isolation to manage secrets across multiple teams or business units</li>\n<li>Integrated HSM support for compliance-critical encryption</li>\n<li>Logging, monitoring, and security data needed for audits in one central place</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Building a foundation for the AI era</h2>\n\n<p>GEICO is currently in the middle of its five-year transformation, which includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Re-architecting six physical datacenters</li>\n<li>Overhauling 350 edge sites (regional offices and field agents)</li>\n<li>Migrating off bespoke mesh topologies without disrupting the 24/7 business</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Decoupling the network and most security functions made it possible to start doing this without major disruptions to the end users. The resulting efficiency so far has allowed GEICO to shift investment from \u2018keeping the lights on\u2019 to building value that makes their agents more effective and their customers' lives better.</p>\n\n<p>By standardizing identity, secrets, and access controls across environments, GEICO created the flexibility to place workloads where it made the most sense \u2014 based on cost, performance, or future needs like AI. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cPart of getting foundational identity security and network correct is to be able to enable your AI revolution. That was a critical element: how can we reduce our cost to serve and increase our portability, improve our data quality so that we can unlock AI to make our agents that much more effective, that much more productive?\u201d \u2014 Rebecca Weekly, VP, Infrastructure Engineering, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At HashiCorp, we\u2019ve worked with thousands of organizations to help them through their digital transformations.

      "raw_content": "<p>New threats emerge every week, and many vendors respond with narrow, new reactive cybersecurity tool purchases to make sure a specific incident <em>never happens again</em>. The result? Tool sprawl. Some organizations now rely on anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.securus360.com/blog/so-many-cybersecurity-tools-deployed#:%7E:text=Businesses%20typically%20deploy%2045%20cybersecurity,ability%20to%20contain%20active%20attacks.\">45</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/unified-cybersecurity-platform\">83</a> separate cybersecurity tools. </p>\n\n<p>This fragmented approach drives up costs, complicates workflows, and (believe it or not) actually increases risk and makes you less secure due to poor integration and limited visibility.</p>\n\n<p>Business leaders are taking notice:</p>\n\n<h2>What the data says on tool &amp; consolidation trends</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lsvp.com/cyber60-2024-2025/\">50% of CISOs</a> want to consolidate their security tools</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/06/02/new-global-business-research-security-sprawl-increases-risk\">65% of orgs</a> say they have too many security tools, and over half (53%) say their tools can\u2019t be integrated.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-09-12-gartner-survey-shows-seventy-five-percent-of-organizations-are-pursuing-security-vendor-consolidation-in-2022\">75% of organizations</a> aim to reduce their number of security vendors</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-09-12-gartner-survey-shows-seventy-five-percent-of-organizations-are-pursuing-security-vendor-consolidation-in-2022\">65% say consolidation</a> would improve their overall risk posture</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The message is clear: It\u2019s time to shift from being reactive to a more unified, strategic approach to cybersecurity.</p>\n\n<h2>What is cybersecurity tool sprawl?</h2>\n\n<p>Cybersecurity tool sprawl is a situation where you have an unnecessary number of cybersecurity tools when fewer tools could still cover all of the organization's needs for cybersecurity tool features. Fewer tools means easier management and lower costs.</p>\n\n<h2>What is cybersecurity vendor sprawl?</h2>\n\n<p>Same idea. Cybersecurity vendor sprawl is a situation where you have an unnecessary number of cybersecurity vendors when fewer vendors and tools could still cover all of the organization's needs for cybersecurity tool features. More tools from fewer vendors means easier relationship management with vendors and potentially lower costs due to bundling deals.</p>\n\n<h2>What are the negative impacts of tool &amp; vendor sprawl?</h2>\n\n<p>The negative effects of tool and vendor sprawl on costs, productivity, and risk profiles are well documented. But sometimes business leaders don\u2019t understand the full breadth of their potential downsides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Overlapping functionality, unnecessary cost</strong></p>\n\n<p>Multiple tools that fulfill similar use cases are usually an unnecessary cost.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Detection is harder</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Vendor tools don\u2019t share data well, often resulting in missed opportunities to detect and correlate signals.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Too many tools, too many dashboards</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having to log into dozens of tools to analyze issues reduces productivity and increases the risk of missing vital alerts.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Higher integration workload</strong></p>\n\n<p>More tools mean more integration work \u2014 that is, assuming the tools support integration into a centralized dashboard.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Hard to debug and run audits (and run AI)</strong></p>\n\n<p>With more tools, it becomes harder to read and aggregate cybersecurity logs and other data into central locations for fast debugging and auditing, which means longer investigations and more lengthy, expensive audit cycles. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shadow IT creates more attack surfaces</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes tool sprawl is the result of shadow IT. This can sometimes open up more attack surfaces because those tools are not being used with company policies in mind. In a 2020 <a href=\"https://www.cisoplatform.com/profiles/blogs/gartner-predicts-30-of-breaches-due-to-shadow-it-by-2020\">report</a>, Gartner estimated that nearly one-third of all successful cyberattacks come from shadow IT infrastructure. With significant tool sprawl, you've created a virtual shadow IT regardless of whether it was done intentionally or not, because it's extremely hard to have enterprise security visibility over so many tools.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Alert fatigue</strong></p>\n\n<p>The more cybersecurity tools you have, the more alerts you\u2019ll likely get. Many tools are hard to fine-tune so that they don\u2019t produce a litany of false positives.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Too many vendors to potentially contact for support</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vendor sprawl means there are a multitude of vendors to track down and collaborate with when your inevitable support needs arise. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Worse sales deals</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you are buying lots of tools, budgeting and procurement becomes more complex and there are fewer opportunities for volume discounts.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Lost synergy gains</strong></p>\n\n<p>A DIY, custom-integrated cybersecurity toolchain requires more maintenance, and organizations miss out on many of the synergy gains that come from using a suite of tools that work together as a platform out of the box.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Slower incident response</strong></p>\n\n<p>As the number of cybersecurity tools, tests, and interfaces grows, it takes longer to update security policies, implement patches consistently across all environments, and complete threat analyses.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>More maintenance costs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aside from integration maintenance, more tools also mean more maintenance in general. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to start your cybersecurity consolidation initiative</h2>\n\n<p>Tool sprawl is a growing problem, but it\u2019s also a solvable one. With the right strategy, organizations can reduce risk, streamline operations, and unlock real cost savings.</p>\n\n<p>Coming up in <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/how-to-start-consolidating-your-cybersecurity-tools\">part two of this blog</a>, we\u2019ll map out how to get started with cybersecurity toolchain rationalization and vendor consolidation, from aligning key teams to auditing your tooling landscape and identifying high-impact changes.  Stay tuned.</p>\n\n<h2>Real world case studies on consolidation</h2>\n\n<p>Organizational leaders must push their cybersecurity, engineering, and infrastructure operations teams to reduce complexity by centralizing and consolidating on a handful of security platforms rather than a litany of smaller cybersecurity tools.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/roche-s-transition-from-tools-to-platforms-with-terraform-and-vault\">Roche</a> and many other companies run successful cybersecurity product consolidation initiatives, and we\u2019d love to share more insights.

The root cause wasn\u2019t just unethical behavior but a flawed approach to performance measurement. When Wells Fargo\u2019s leadership incentivized employees to sell eight financial products per customer, they inadvertently encouraged gaming behaviors that harmed customers, employees, and ultimately the bank itself. The metric had become more important than its underlying business purpose.</p>\n<p>Although Goodhart\u2019s law in action only sometimes rises to the level of scandal, companies everywhere fall prey to it: \u201cWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d Despite decades of warnings against metric fixation, leaders continue to build incentives around narrow indicators, which results in gaming and ethical lapses and harms business performance.</p>\n<p>Traditional solutions to overcoming Goodhart\u2019s \ufefflaw, like balanced scorecards and KPIs, often fail because they remain vulnerable to narrow optimization and gaming behaviors in the absence of careful oversight. The persistence of metric fixation signals a need for a more sophisticated approach to address the problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>A New Lens: Insights From AI Training</h3>\n<p>Leaders increasingly view organizations as systems to be optimized for specific outcomes, much as machine learning researchers optimize algorithms. Since both contexts involve optimizing proxy measures that can diverge from the true goals, solutions from AI research could help solve persistent organizational measurement problems. Of course, organizations consist of people with the agency and complex motivations that algorithms lack, so these techniques provide frameworks that require human adaptation, not mechanistic solutions.</p>\n<p>AI researchers have long studied a phenomenon called overfitting, where machine learning models perform well on training data but fail when faced with real-world scenarios because they can\u2019t generalize to predict outcomes with the new data.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consider a simple hypothetical example: An image recognition model tasked with distinguishing dogs from cats is trained on thousands of pet photos. During training, the system appears to perform flawlessly, correctly identifying every animal in the data. But when shown new photos in the real world, it fails dramatically. Why? The model didn\u2019t learn to recognize the essential features of dogs and cats; instead, it discovered incidental patterns in the training data. Perhaps the dog photos had grass backgrounds while cat photos were taken indoors. The system optimized for measurement (training accuracy), not the underlying goal (identifying real features).</p>\n<p>AI researchers recognize that optimizing too aggressively for proxy measures eventually undermines real-world outcomes. Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, a prominent AI researcher who has pioneered work in this area, has said that \u201cincreased efficiency can sometimes, counterintuitively, lead to worse outcomes,\u201d noting that this happens \u201calmost everywhere,\u201d whether in machine learning or organizational settings.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref1\" id=\"reflink1\">1</a> In machine learning, researchers observe that performance on a model\u2019s true objective follows a particular pattern: It initially improves as the model optimizes for the proxy measure, then plateaus, and eventually deteriorates dramatically as optimization intensifies. This demonstrates how the aggressive pursuit of metrics can destroy the very outcomes those metrics were intended to promote.</p>\n<p>\ufeffThe phenomenon occurs in organizations, too, when teams pursue metrics in ways that disconnect them from their strategic intent: Sales teams hit targets by pushing unwanted products, schools improve test scores by teaching to the test rather than building deeper understanding, or customer service representatives rush through calls to optimize for call-time metrics while sacrificing how completely they solve each customer\u2019s problems. Short-term wins on such metrics can hide or exacerbate deeper issues.</p>\n<p>Understanding how AI researchers avoid the problem of overfitting can help managers rethink how they design and track performance indicators to avoid gaming behaviors or narrow optimization and instead drive meaningful results.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Metric Intelligence Framework in Action</h3>\n<p>Machine learning has evolved four strategies to combat overfitting, each with direct implications for organizational design.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Early stopping: Prevent overoptimization through timely reassessment.</strong> Machine learning researchers discovered that continued training after a certain point harms a model\u2019s performance after it\u2019s fed new data. The solution is \ufeff<em>early stopping</em>, which entails monitoring performance on separate data and halting optimization when validation performance peaks, even if training performance could improve further.</p>\n<p>In a typical image recognition system, engineers might train the model on thousands of labeled images while regularly testing it on separate validation images. They may track the error rate on both sets and stop training when validation error starts to increase \u2014 a signal of overfitting \u2014 even if training error is still decreasing.</p>\n<p>Organizations can implement early stopping by regularly reassessing metrics against true objectives. Amazon implements this principle by periodically reviewing and adjusting its performance metrics. The company famously shifted its primary metric focus <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312505070440/dex991.htm\" target=\"_blank\">from profit margins to free cash flow per share</a> in 2004. This prevents teams from overoptimizing for any single metric and ensures alignment with changing business needs.</p>\n<p>Intel\u2019s experience in the late 1990s illustrates \ufeffthe process. The company had long emphasized processor clock speed as its primary performance metric and marketing focus. When auditing \ufeffthe metric, Intel discovered that continued optimization for speed was causing excessive power consumption, overheated chips, and diminishing returns in actual computing performance. This realization prompted Intel to shift toward a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2006/06/01/229027/intels-new-strategy-power-efficiency/\" target=\"_blank\">more balanced set of metrics</a> that included energy efficiency and overall computing capabilities \u2014 measurements that better aligned with customer value.</p>\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s shift to a more fluid goal-setting process exemplifies these same principles. When Satya Nadella became Microsoft\u2019s CEO in 2014, he devoted significant attention to helping the organization understand that metrics like revenue and profit were imperfect proxies for the company\u2019s broader mission.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref2\" id=\"reflink2\">2</a> This cultural shift away from metric fixation and toward an understanding of measurement limitations helped Microsoft employees make decisions that balanced quantitative targets with qualitative judgment. Instead of adhering to annual targets regardless of market changes, the company now conducts quarterly business reviews where teams can adjust their metrics and goals based on changing conditions and emerging data. \ufeffThe approach allows the organization to stop optimization for metrics that are becoming counterproductive.</p>\n<p>Another way to apply early stopping is by setting minimum targets rather than maximization goals. Unlike Wells Fargo\u2019s \u201ceight products per customer\u201d \u2014 which drove aggressive selling\u2014 true minimum targets establish a threshold of acceptable performance without rewards for exceeding it. For instance, a customer service department might set a minimum target of resolving 85% of inquiries within 24 hours. Once teams meet these minimum standards, they can focus on other dimensions of performance, preventing overfitting to any single metric.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent\">\n<aside class=\"l-content-wrap\">\n<article>\n<h4>Organizational Example: Sales Metrics Versus Customer Value</h4>\n<p class=\"caption\">Increasing performance on a single metric past an optimal point can harm other indicators of value.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Organizational Example: Sales Metrics Versus Customer Value\" src=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SP26_FE_Kovacs_1.png\" /></p>\n</article>\n</aside>\n</div>\n<p><strong>2. Noise \ufeffinjection: Build robustness \ufeffthrough \ufeffcontrolled \ufeffrandomness. </strong>AI systems benefit from deliberate randomness. When models rely too heavily on specific patterns, they memorize quirks rather than learning genuine relationships. As in our earlier example, if all dog photos in the training data have grass backgrounds, the model might learn \u201cgrass means dog\u201d rather than identifying actual canine features. To prevent such overfitting, some connections in the model are randomly turned off during training. Similarly, slightly altering training data, such as rotating images or adding background noise to audio, ensures that the AI learns meaningful patterns instead of irrelevant coincidences. This approach is known as noise injection.</p>\n<p>Organizations can apply noise injection in other contexts by conducting random audits, rotating team compositions, shuffling decision makers, or varying operational conditions. A sales team that always presents to the same manager might optimize for that person\u2019s preferences rather than customer value. By introducing controlled variability, organizations can prevent people from gaming predictable patterns.</p>\n<p>Financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase use random compliance audits that mirror AI\u2019s noise injection techniques. By making the timing of evaluations unpredictable, it discourages employees from developing workarounds or gaming behaviors that might emerge under predictable assessment schedules. The effectiveness of this approach is well documented in the IRS\u2019s random-audit program, where studies show each dollar invested in random audits generates up to $6 in additional revenue through deterrence effects.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref3\" id=\"reflink3\">3</a> Research has also found that randomly audited taxpayers maintain higher compliance for at least five years following an audit, with long-term benefits that exceed the immediate revenue recovered.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref4\" id=\"reflink4\">4</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implements this principle through its unannounced-inspection program for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Unlike scheduled audits, where facilities can temporarily optimize for evaluation day, surprise inspections prevent companies from hiding compliance issues. These random evaluations consistently reveal problems that would have been concealed during planned assessments, thus encouraging companies to maintain continuous compliance. These random evaluations proved so effective that the FDA expanded its unannounced-inspection program in 2025.</p>\n<p>Customer service organizations apply this principle when they use mystery shoppers who appear at unpredictable times, preventing retail staff members from providing excellent service only when they expect to be evaluated. Sales organizations might randomly audit customer interactions rather than focusing exclusively on closed deals, ensuring that representatives maintain ethical standards throughout the sales process. The Transportation Security Administration rotates screening personnel across different checkpoints and functions \u2014 baggage screening, metal detectors, document verification \u2014 to prevent security gaps that could emerge from predictable assignments. For instance, if the same guard always screened the same checkpoint, bad actors could study their screening patterns or even cultivate relationships with them to engage in social engineering. Random rotation ensures that no one can predict or influence who will be conducting their screening.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Capacity \ufeffalignment: Match \ufeffmetric \ufeffcomplexity to \ufefforganizational \ufeffcapabilities. </strong>Machine learning researchers match model complexity to their data and monitoring capabilities. This means that a team with millions of training examples and strong validation methods can safely deploy complex models with many parameters, whereas teams with limited data must use simpler models to avoid overfitting.</p>\n<p>Organizations should also match metric complexity with their oversight abilities. A company with advanced analytics infrastructure and skilled data scientists can implement complex, multidimensional metrics while maintaining integrity. Organizations with limited oversight capacity should stick to simpler, more robust metrics, even if they capture fewer nuances. The risk rises when metric complexity outpaces the quality of data and oversight. The same failure happens in machine learning: Overly complex models trained on limited data quickly collapse, especially when the same small validation set is used again and again.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref5\" id=\"reflink5\">5</a></p>\n<p>WeWork\u2019s \u201ccommunity adjusted EBITDA\u201d illustrates this dangerous middle ground. The company created a metric that excluded not just standard EBITDA adjustments but also basic operating expenses like marketing, administrative costs, and development spending. This metric was complex enough to obscure the company\u2019s financial position from investors who lacked the expertise to dissect it, yet it wasn\u2019t a sophisticated measure that captured real business performance. When the Securities and Exchange Commission intervened, requesting the metric\u2019s removal from WeWork\u2019s S-1 filing, the company attempted to rename it \u201ccontribution margin\u201d to satisfy regulators. By then, however, the metric had already helped attract billions in investment despite being meaningless for evaluating business health. WeWork\u2019s eventual bankruptcy proved that its business model was fundamentally flawed.</p>\n<p>Similar dynamics have played out in the financial sector. In the early 2010s, several major banks implemented sophisticated risk assessment metrics following the financial crisis, but many lacked the analytical infrastructure to properly validate those measures. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/imo/media/doc/REPORT%20-%20JPMorgan%20Chase%20Whale%20Trades%20(4-12-13).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading incident</a> in 2012 revealed this problem. The bank implemented a sophisticated Value-at-Risk model that proved to be fatally flawed, with spreadsheet errors that understated risk by 50%. The model\u2019s complexity allowed traders to game the system by manipulating price inputs within technically acceptable ranges, and risk managers lacked the analytical infrastructure to detect either the errors or the manipulation. This toxic combination of a sophisticated but broken model, deliberate gaming, and inadequate oversight capabilities resulted in over $6 billion in losses.</p>\n<p>Startups excel at alignment by focusing on simple metrics suited to their stage, such as customer acquisition cost, monthly recurring revenue, and retention rates. These are easy to track and directly tied to goals like product-market fit and cash flow. As businesses grow, metrics expand to include unit economics like lifetime value to acquisition cost, net revenue retention, cohort analysis, and service-level objectives. Large enterprises use more advanced analytics, tracking predictive customer health scores, experiment uplift, model performance and fairness in AI systems, and risk-adjusted ROI across portfolios. These are often integrated into balanced scorecards that connect financial, customer, and operational indicators.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-highlight\">\n<aside class=\"l-content-wrap\">\n<article>\n<h4>The Metric Distortion Test</h4>\n<p class=\"caption\">\n<p><strong>Is your organization vulnerable to metric fixation?

Regularization: Create \ufeffbalance \ufeffthrough \ufeffsimplicity \ufeffincentives. </strong>Regularization addresses a core problem in both AI and organizations: the tendency to optimize so effectively for a proxy measure that it actively harms the true goal leaders care about.</p>\n<p>In machine learning, regularization helps models avoid becoming overly specific, by penalizing excessive complexity. For instance, some methods penalize overly detailed rules, encouraging models to identify simpler, more general patterns. Without regularization, models become too tailored to training data and perform poorly when faced with new data. Organizations can implement this principle similarly: Adding constraints prevents the complex gaming behaviors that arise from excessive optimization. The constraints make gaming the system more complex and costly than performing well. Just as regularization forces AI models toward simpler patterns, organizational constraints make straightforward good performance simpler than elaborate gaming strategies.</p>\n<p>Amazon\u2019s approach to seller ratings illustrates this principle. Its algorithm can detect unusual patterns in customer feedback, such as sudden spikes in five-star reviews from accounts with a minimal purchase history or clusters of generic reviews posted within short time windows. Such patterns indicate that a seller has been soliciting positive reviews, which is prohibited and results in severe penalties. This constraint prevents sellers from gaming the review system and maintains alignment between the proxy measure (star ratings) and the true goal (seller quality). Without such constraints, sellers would find ways to inflate their ratings at the cost of real service quality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Netflix recognized that optimizing solely for \ufeffhours viewed\ufeff could incentivize the production of content that captures attention without providing value that retains subscribers. To prevent this distortion, Netflix implemented a multi-metric approach. As the <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report\" target=\"_blank\">company stated</a>, \u201cSuccess on Netflix comes in all shapes and sizes, and is not determined by hours viewed alone.\u201d In 2023, it switched to a \ufeffviews\ufeff metric (hours viewed divided by runtime), calling it \u201cour best measure of member satisfaction and a key driver of retention.\u201d By using multiple complementary metrics that balanced one another, Netflix created the organizational equivalent of regularization: preventing any single measurement from being gamed at the expense of true viewer satisfaction. This strategy has enabled the company to invest in diverse content with varying time horizons rather than focusing on immediate viewership metrics, supporting its long-term competitive position.</p>\n<p>Organizations can balance growth and efficiency through regularization by adding complexity penalties to highly optimized processes. After discovering that pure profit maximization was leading to environmental concerns, Unilever incorporated sustainability requirements as constraints on profit-seeking through its <a href=\"https://oxfordexecutive.co.uk/case-study-unilevers-sustainable-living-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Living Plan</a>. Instead of adding complexity, these requirements function as regularization terms that prevent extreme profit optimization by requiring balanced performance across multiple dimensions.</p>\n<p>Progressive compensation structures also serve as regularization tools. Whole Foods (before its acquisition by Amazon) implemented <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/before-amazon-deal-whole-foods-also-stood-for-moderate-executive-pay/\" target=\"_blank\">executive salary caps</a> tied to average worker compensation, creating a natural constraint against optimizing solely for leadership enrichment. Some organizations have found success with increased oversight mechanisms for teams that consistently exceed targets, triggering automatic reviews to verify that exceptional results aren\u2019t coming at the expense of unmeasured dimensions. Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s provides another example (notwithstanding recent turmoil at the company), with its <a href=\"https://benandjerrysfoundation.org/about/what-we-do/\" target=\"_blank\">required community engagement investments</a> tied to growth initiatives, ensuring that profit maximization remains balanced with social impact considerations.</p>\n<p>Regularization isn\u2019t about making things simpler. It\u2019s about setting constraints that keep optimization aligned with real goals. These constraints work best when they create balanced incentive structures that discourage extreme behaviors while still rewarding genuine improvement.</p>\n<p>By adapting these solutions, organizations can maintain the benefits of measurement while avoiding the pitfalls of metric fixation. Each strategy addresses a different aspect of the Goodhart\u2019s law problem, creating a framework for intelligent organizational metrics that drive performance without encouraging gaming behaviors.</p>\n<h3>The Future of Intelligent Measurement</h3>\n<p>The combination of artificial intelligence research and organizational design offers practical solutions to metric fixation. By applying techniques that keep AI models aligned with real-world goals, managers can improve how organizational performance is measured.</p>\n<p>These approaches must work in concert rather than isolation. Organizations adopting metric intelligence treat measurement as an ongoing practice requiring constant refinement, not a \ufeff\u201cset it and forget it\u201d solution. Successful implementations involve those who will be measured in designing the measurement system, resulting in both better metrics and greater buy-in for the new practices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Adopting this framework means overcoming hurdles familiar to both managers and AI developers. Leaders need to have patience and resist pressure for short-term results, just as AI teams hold off on deploying models \ufeffuntil they\u2019re fully trained and tested. Cultural resistance to new metrics parallels the trust issues with black-box algorithms, whose decisions can seem opaque. And success depends on integration: Metrics must connect across organizational silos, just as new algorithms must be woven into existing software and operations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, while these AI-inspired approaches improve measurement, they require careful human oversight. As Jerry Muller argues in his book <cite>The Tyranny of Metrics</cite>, not everything that matters can be quantified, and \u2014 given that organizations consist of individuals with complex motivations and behaviors \u2014 managerial judgment remains essential.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref6\" id=\"reflink6\">6</a> The ideal approach balances structure with flexibility, adding enough friction to prevent gaming without stifling initiative\ufeff and employing sufficient measures without drowning in data.</p>\n<p>This matters now because metrics are becoming more numerous and detailed. Without improved measurement strategies, organizations risk repeating past mistakes of narrow optimization. As AI agents increasingly take on direct roles within organizations, robust performance metrics become even more important. The insights from AI training won\u2019t just help managers measure human performance effectively; they will guide how goals are set and evaluated for AI workers.</p>\n<p></p>",
