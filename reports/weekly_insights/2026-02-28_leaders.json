Kimwolf&#8217;s ability to scan the local networks of compromised systems for other IoT devices to infect makes it a sobering threat to organizations, and new research reveals Kimwolf is surprisingly prevalent in government and corporate networks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73083\" style=\"width: 625px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73083\" height=\"615\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ss-botnet.png\" width=\"615\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73083\">Image: Shutterstock, @Elzicon.</p></div>\n<p>Kimwolf grew rapidly in the waning months of 2025 by tricking various &#8220;residential proxy&#8221; services into relaying malicious commands to devices on the local networks of those proxy endpoints. Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one&#8217;s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.</p>\n<p>The malware that turns one&#8217;s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic &#8212; including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping.</p>\n<p>Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from <strong>IPIDEA</strong>, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">forward malicious commands</a> to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint&#8217;s local network.</p>\n<p>Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf&#8217;s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. These are typically Android Open Source Project devices &#8212; not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices &#8212; and they are generally marketed as a way to watch unlimited (read:pirated) video content from popular subscription streaming services for a one-time fee.</p>\n<p>However, a great many of these TV boxes ship to consumers with residential proxy software pre-installed. What&#8217;s more, they have no real security or authentication built-in: If you can communicate directly with the TV box, you can also easily compromise it with malware.</p>\n<p>While IPIDEA and other affected proxy providers recently have taken steps to block threats like Kimwolf from going upstream into their endpoints (reportedly with varying degrees of success), the Kimwolf malware remains on millions of infected devices.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73086\" style=\"width: 757px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73086\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ipidea2023.png\" width=\"747\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73086\">A screenshot of IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy service.</p></div>\n<p>Kimwolf&#8217;s close association with residential proxy networks and compromised Android TV boxes might suggest we&#8217;d find relatively few infections on corporate networks. However, the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> said a recent review of its customer traffic found <em>nearly 25 percent of them made a query to a Kimwolf-related domain name since October 1, 2025</em>, when the botnet first showed signs of life.</p>\n<p>Infoblox found the affected customers are based all over the world and in a wide range of industry verticals, from education and healthcare to government and finance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be clear, this suggests that nearly 25% of customers had at least one device that was an endpoint in a residential proxy service targeted by Kimwolf operators,&#8221; Infoblox <a href=\"https://www.infoblox.com/blog/threat-intelligence/kimwolf-howls-from-inside-the-enterprise/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a>. &#8220;Such a device, maybe a phone or a laptop, was essentially co-opted by the threat actor to probe the local network for vulnerable devices. A query means a scan was made, not that new devices were compromised. Lateral movement would fail if there were no vulnerable devices to be found or if the DNS resolution was blocked.&#8221;<span id=\"more-73065\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Synthient</strong>, a startup that tracks proxy services and was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the first to disclose on January 2</a> the unique methods Kimwolf uses to spread, found proxy endpoints from IPIDEA were present in alarming numbers at government and academic institutions worldwide. Synthient said it spied at least 33,000 affected Internet addresses at universities and colleges, and nearly 8,000 IPIDEA proxies within various U.S. and foreign government networks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73093\" style=\"width: 759px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73093\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/top50targetedomains.jpeg\" width=\"749\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73093\">The top 50 domain names sought out by users of IPIDEA&#8217;s residential proxy service, according to Synthient.</p></div>\n<p>In a webinar on January 16, experts at the proxy tracking service <strong>Spur</strong> profiled Internet addresses associated with IPIDEA and 10 other proxy services that were thought to be vulnerable to Kimwolf&#8217;s tricks. Spur found residential proxies in nearly 300 government owned and operated networks, 318 utility companies, 166 healthcare companies or hospitals, and 141 companies in banking and finance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I looked at the 298 [government] owned and operated [networks], and so many of them were DoD [U.S. Department of Defense], which is kind of terrifying that DoD has IPIDEA and these other proxy services located inside of it,&#8221; Spur Co-Founder <strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how these enterprises have these networks set up. It could be that [infected devices] are segregated on the network, that even if you had local access it doesn&#8217;t really mean much. However, it&#8217;s something to be aware of. If a device goes in, anything that device has access to the proxy would have access to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kilmer said Kimwolf demonstrates how a single residential proxy infection can quickly lead to bigger problems for organizations that are harboring unsecured devices behind their firewalls, noting that proxy services present a potentially simple way for attackers to probe other devices on the local network of a targeted organization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you know you have [proxy] infections that are located in a company, you can chose that [network] to come out of and then locally pivot,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;If you have an idea of where to start or look, now you have a foothold in a company or an enterprise based on just that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is the third story in our series on the Kimwolf botnet.

A few years later, however, thin clients in the form of a monitor and keyboard arrived:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"A 1970s terminal for accessing a mainframe\" class=\"wp-image-18325\" height=\"1064\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/thin-ai-3.png?resize=1330%2C1064&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1330\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no computer in this image; rather, this is a terminal connected to a mainframe. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called a &#8220;thin&#8221; client: it&#8217;s just an interface, with all of the computing happening elsewhere (i.e. in another room). By the 1980s, however, &#8220;thick&#8221; clients were the dominant form of computing, in the form of the PC. All of your I/O and compute were packaged together: you typed on a keyboard connected to a PC, which output to the monitor in front of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"A 1980s IBM PC\" class=\"wp-image-18326\" height=\"966\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/thin-ai-2.png?resize=1330%2C966&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1330\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A decade later, and Sun Microsystems in particular tried to push the idea of a &#8220;network computer&#8221;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"A Sun Javastation\" class=\"wp-image-18327\" height=\"998\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/thin-ai-4.png?resize=1330%2C998&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1330\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Adrian Cockcroft, CC-SA 4.0</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a device that didn&#8217;t really have a local operating system; you ran Java applications and Java applets from a browser that were downloaded as they were used from a central server. Sun&#8217;s pitch was that network computers would be much cheaper and easier to administer, but PCs were dropping in price so quickly that the value proposition rapidly disappeared, and Windows so dominant that it was already the only platform that network administrators wanted to deal with. Thick clients won, and won decisively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wanted to make a case for thin clients, you could argue that mobile devices are a hybrid; after all, the rise of mobile benefited from and drove the rise of the cloud: nearly every app on a phone connects to a server somewhere. Ultimately, however, mobile devices are themselves thick clients: they are very capable computers in their own right, that certainly benefit from being connected to a server, but are useful without it. Critically, the server component is just data: the actual interface is entirely local.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can make the same argument about SaaS apps: on one hand, yes, they operate in the cloud and are usually accessed via a browser; on the other hand, the modern browser is basically an operating system in its own right, and the innovations that made SaaS apps possible were the fact that interactive web apps could be downloaded and run locally. Granted, this isn&#8217;t far off from Sun&#8217;s vision (although the language ended up being JavaScript, not Java), but you still need a lot of local compute to make these apps work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI vs. UI</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The thick-versus-thin debate felt, for many years, like a relic; that&#8217;s how decisive was the thick client victory. One of the things that is fascinating about AI, however, is that the thin client concept is not just back, it&#8217;s dominant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clearest example of this is the interface that most people use to interact with AI: chat. There is no UI that matters other than a text field and a submit button; when you click that button the text is sent to a data center, where all of the computation happens, and an answer is sent back to you. The quality of the answer or of the experience as a whole is largely independent of the device you are using: it could be a browser on a PC, an app on a high-end smartphone, or the cheapest Android device you can find. The device could be a car, or glasses, or just an earpiece. The local compute that matters is not processing power, but rather connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interaction paradigm actually looks a lot like the interaction paradigm for mainframe computers: type text into a terminal, send it to the computer, and get a response back. Unlike mainframe terminals, however, the user doesn&#8217;t need to know a deterministic set of commands; you just say what you want in plain language and the computer understands. There is no pressure for local compute capability to drive a user interface that makes the computer easier to use, because a more complex user interface would artificially constrain the AI&#8217;s capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicolas Bustamante, in <a href=\"https://x.com/nicbstme/status/2023501562480644501?s=48\">an X Article about the prospects for vertical software in an AI world</a>, explained why this is threatening:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>When the interface is a natural language conversation, years of muscle memory become worthless. The switching cost that justified $25K per seat per year dissolves. For many vertical software companies, the interface was most of the value. The underlying data was licensed, public, or semi-commoditized. What justified premium pricing was the workflow built on top of that data. That&#8217;s over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Bustamante&#8217;s post is about much more than chat interfaces, but I think the user interface point is profound: it&#8217;s less that AI user interfaces are different, and more that, for many use cases, they basically don&#8217;t exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is even clearer when you consider the next big wave of AI: agents. The point of an agent is not to use the computer for you; it&#8217;s to accomplish a specific task. Everything between the request and the result, at least in theory, should be invisible to the user. This is the concept of a thin client taken to the absolute extreme: it&#8217;s not just that you don&#8217;t need any local compute to get an answer from a chatbot; you don&#8217;t need any local compute to accomplish real work. The AI on the server does it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course most agentic workflows that work tread a golden path, but stumble with more complex situations or edge cases. That, though, is changing rapidly, as models become better and the capabilities of the chips running them increase, particularly in terms of memory. When it comes to inference, memory isn&#8217;t just important for holding the model weights, but also retaining context about the task at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date most of the memory that matters has been high-bandwidth memory attached to the GPUs, but <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2026/nvidia-at-ces-vera-rubin-and-ai-native-storage-infrastructure-alpamayo/\">future architectures will offload context to flash storage</a>. At the same time, managing agents is <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2026/intel-earnings-the-agentic-opportunity-intels-mistaken-pessimism/\">best suited to CPUs</a>, which themselves need large amounts of DRAM. In short, both the amount of compute we have, and the capability of that compute, still isn&#8217;t good enough; once it crosses that threshold, though, demand will only get that much stronger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination of factors will only accentuate the dominance of the thin client paradigm:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>First, if compute isn&#8217;t yet good enough, then workloads will flow to wherever compute is the best, which is going to be in large data centers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Second, if larger models and more context makes for better results, then workloads will flow to wherever there is the most memory available.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Third, the expense of furnishing this level of compute means that it will be far more economical to share the cost of that compute amongst millions of users; guaranteeing high utilization and maximizing leverage on your up-front costs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you can run large language models locally, but you are limited in the size of the model, the size of the context window, and speed. Meanwhile, the superior models with superior context windows and faster speeds don&#8217;t require a trip to the computer lab; just connect to the Internet from anywhere. Note that this reality applies even to incredible new local tools like OpenClaw: OpenClaw is an orchestration layer that runs locally, but the actual AI inference is, by default and in practice for most users, done by models in the cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it another way, to be competitive, local inference would need some combination of smaller-yet-sufficiently-capable models, a breakthrough in context management, and critically, lots and lots of memory. It&#8217;s that last one that might be the biggest problem of all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Memory Crowd-Out</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis\">Bloomberg</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>A growing procession of tech industry leaders including Elon Musk and Tim Cook are warning about a global crisis in the making: A shortage of memory chips is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers \u2014 and the crunch is only going to get worse\u2026</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sony Group Corp. is now considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s thinking. That would be a major upset to a carefully orchestrated strategy to sustain user engagement between hardware generations. Close rival Nintendo Co., which contributed to the surplus demand in 2025 after its new Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases, is also contemplating raising the price of that device in 2026, people familiar with its plans said. Sony and Nintendo representatives didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A manager at a laptop maker said Samsung Electronics has recently begun reviewing its memory supply contracts every quarter or so, versus generally on an annual basis. Chinese smartphone makers including Xiaomi Corp., Oppo and Shenzhen Transsion Holdings Co. are trimming shipment targets for 2026, with Oppo cutting its forecast by as much as 20%, Chinese media outlet Jiemian reported. The companies did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The memory shortage has been looming for a while, and is arguably the place where consumers will truly feel the impact of AI; <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2026/nvidia-at-ces-vera-rubin-and-ai-native-storage-infrastructure-alpamayo/\">I wrote in January</a> in the context of Nvidia&#8217;s keynote at CES:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-stratechery is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>CES stands for \u201cConsumer Electronics Show\u201d, and while Nvidia\u2019s gaming GPUs received some updates, they weren\u2019t a part of [Nvidia CEO Jensen] Huang\u2019s keynote, which was focused on that Vera Rubin AI system and self-driving cars. In other words, there wasn\u2019t really anything for the consumer, despite the location, because AI took center stage. This is fine as far as Nvidia goes: both the Vera Rubin announcement and its new Alpamayo self-driving system are big deals. It is, however, symbolic of the impact AI is having on technology broadly, and that impact is set to impact consumer electronics in a major way. Specifically, not only is all of the energy and investment in the tech sector going towards AI, but so is the supply chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big story over the last few months has been the dramatically escalating cost of memory as the major memory manufacturers shift their focus to high-bandwidth memory for AI chips in particular. What that means is that everything else is going to get a lot more expensive: memory is one of the most expensive components in nearly everything tech-related, and given the competitive and commoditized nature of the industry those costs will almost certainly be passed on to the end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This AI crowd-out dynamic arguably started with the hyperscalers, who diverted ever increasing parts of their budget to GPUs in place of CPU purchases, but now it\u2019s coming for everything from grid power to turbines and now to components, and it\u2019s only going to increase and become more impactful to end users. In other words, Nvidia may not have talked about consumer electronics at the Consumer Electronics Show, but they are having the biggest impact on the industry by far.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The downsides of this crowd-out effect are obvious; I pity anyone trying to build their own PC, for example, but soon their pain will be everyone&#8217;s pain as prices inevitably rise on everything that needs RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I think the reported PlayStation delay is telling: apparently the PS5 is &#8220;good enough&#8221; for Sony to wait for more memory capacity to come online, and they&#8217;re probably right! Thick clients \u2014 of which consoles like the PS5 are the ultimate example \u2014 have long since reached the point of diminishing returns when it comes to hardware improvements. I think you could make the same case for PCs and phones as well: what we already have is already more than sufficient for almost any task we want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the plateau in thick client capability is happening at the same time that the need for any capability at all is disappearing, thanks to these entirely new AI workflows that happen in the cloud. Yes, it sucks that AI is making memory scarce and personal computers of all kinds \u2014 from PCs to phones to consoles \u2014 more expensive; it&#8217;s also making them less important than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Of course thick clients could make a comeback, particularly since local inference is &#8220;free&#8221; (i.e. the user pays for their own electricity). As I noted above, however, I&#8217;m skeptical about local inference in the near term for performance reasons, and the memory crunch is going to make it uneconomical for the foreseeable future. And, by the time local inference is a viable alternative, path dependency downstream of these few years may have already led to many workflows moving to this new paradigm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will, to be clear, be a transition: UI isn&#8217;t just about how to use a computer, it also, as <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2026/an-interview-with-benedict-evans-about-ai-and-software/\">Benedict Evans noted on a recent Interview</a>, embeds critical aspects of how a business works. Open-ended text prompts in particular are a terrible replacement for a well-considered UI button that both prompts the right action and ensures the right thing happens. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s the agent space that will be the one to watch: what workflows will transition from UI to AI, and thus from a thick client architecture to a thin one? Current workflows are TBD; future workflows seem inevitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignfull is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>",

Some victims reportedly are paying &#8212; perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a &#8220;We&#8217;re not paying&#8221; response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group&#8217;s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73160\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73160\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/dontfeed.png\" width=\"748\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73160\">Image: Shutterstock.com, @Mungujakisa</p></div>\n<p>Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s according to <strong>Allison Nixon</strong>, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy <a href=\"https://unit221b.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unit 221B</a>. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they&#8217;ll do &#8212; such as destroying stolen data.</p>\n<p>Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that &#8212; to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim&#8217;s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.</p>\n<p>SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/expansion-shinyhunters-saas-data-theft\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a January 30 blog post</a>, Google&#8217;s security forensics firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> said SLSH&#8217;s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,&#8221; the blog post explained.</p>\n<p>Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.</p>\n<p>Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to &#8220;swatting&#8221; attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target&#8217;s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A big part of what they&#8217;re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives&#8217; kids and threatening the board of the company,&#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they&#8217;re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, &#8216;Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we&#8217;re going to write about you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.unit221b.com/dont-read-this-blog/harassment-scare-tactics-why-victims-should-never-pay-shinyhunters\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post today</a>, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH&#8217;s known members hail from <strong>The Com</strong>, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration</a>.</p>\n<p>Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren\u2019t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,&#8221; Nixon wrote. &#8220;They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms &#8211; unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and &#8220;promise&#8221; to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:</p>\n<p>A key component of SLSH&#8217;s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal \u2018win\u2019 to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73163\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-73163\" height=\"92\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" width=\"748\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73163\">An excerpt from a sextortion tutorial from a Com-based Telegram channel. Image: Unit 221B.</p></div>\n<p>Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group&#8217;s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,&#8221; Unit 221B&#8217;s advisory reads. &#8220;Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or &#8220;A.N&#8221;), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists\u2014especially Brian Krebs\u2014or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.&#8221;</p>",
