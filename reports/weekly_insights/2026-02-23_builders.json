Every cloud provider was configured differently. And we have about 30 years of one-offs.\u201d\u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So how did GEICO finally set itself on a path to do cloud right and build the right foundation for AI? </p>\n\n<p>This post, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKd5j6A7Nt0\">based on a talk from HashiConf</a>, outlines the important hybrid cloud management lessons GEICO learned and how HashiCorp Vault played a major role in building its new infrastructure platform. </p>\n\n<h2>Stop securing the network, start securing identity</h2>\n\n<p>GEICO\u2019s Rebecca Weekly (VP, Infrastructure Engineering) and Ammar Zuberi (Distinguished Engineer, Infrastructure) explained one of their teams\u2019 first observations: many of their woes were a result of their legacy, network-centric security model.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, GEICO \u2014 like many enterprises \u2014 used the network to enforce security. Firewalls, VLANs, and point-to-point rules dictated who could access what. That approach worked when infrastructure was static. It breaks down fast in hybrid and multi-cloud environments.</p>\n\n<p>Using the network as a comprehensive security perimeter created fragility, slow change cycles, and security blind spots. There was no single end-to-end view of access or posture, and every change required coordination across teams and vendors.</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>Their solution</u></strong>: move security up the stack and enforce policy as close to users and workloads as possible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe decided that the network only has to do one job, which is move packets from point A to point B. We should do security at higher layers in our network, so we decided that we're going to make our network as simple as possible.\u201d\u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They started to shift away from their legacy network security model and adopted a new approach that involves:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Enforcing policy at the platform and workload layers, tied to identity</li>\n<li>Certificates and identity from an IdP, enabling their new identity-first security approach</li>\n<li>Segmenting traffic at the workload level instead of the network level</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;We could move these security requirements into the platform layers where you could get much more granular about what policies you were allowing and what kind of access was allowed. ... As far as security goes, as a workload owner, you're optimizing for a business process. You don't need to care as much about security.&quot; \u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMake your policy as close to your user or your workload as possible. That is the only way to scale. Period. Full stop.\u201d \u2014 Rebecca Weekly, VP, Infrastructure Engineering, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not only did this shift modernize their security posture, it also made the network more reliable and the workload deployment experience much better.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Centralize identity and secrets to regain control</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Once GEICO stopped relying on the network for security, identity became the control plane.</p>\n\n<p>That meant rethinking how secrets, certificates, and workload identities were created, distributed, and governed across a sprawling hybrid cloud environment.</p>\n\n<p>Before this shift:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Certificates were often handled manually</li>\n<li>There was no consistent certificate management strategy</li>\n<li>Access <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/the-pain-points-of-vpns-in-enterprise-it\">through a VPN</a> was broad and tied to network location rather than identity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_TDM_RISK_geico-blog_PRODUCTPAGE&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=product_page\">HashiCorp Vault</a> became a keystone of GEICO's new security model, providing an organizationally consistent way to manage secrets and identities across on-prem and multi-cloud environments.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe use workload identities, certificates, things like that that we got out of HashiCorp Vault to centralize authentication, policy enforcement, and the management of those secrets.\u201d\u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just as importantly, Vault brought standardization to their security practices.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt forced us to standardize our access policies into a single place where we could actually reason about them.\u201d\u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Build vs. buy</h2>\n\n<p>GEICO started its Vault adoption with Vault community edition, but quickly realized that spending time building more features on top of that, which they needed to meet regulations, was going to involve too much time and money spent on features that didn\u2019t differentiate their business:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c'We're going to build it all ourselves. We can do everything.' And then what we found in the process was that there were requirements for auditors in different domains that we could have built, but it probably would have taken us N months, and we needed to be compliant today. And that was really the outcome around controlling our own destiny and making the right decisions for us as a business. So we made the decision to move forward with HashiCorp\u2019s version of Vault, and that allowed us to get these features out of the box versus having to build them for ourselves.\u201d \u2014 Ammar Zuberi, Distinguished Infrastructure Engineer, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These out-of-the-box features that GEICO needed included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated FIPS compliance</li>\n<li>Multi-region, high-availability Vault cluster replication</li>\n<li>Automated snapshots for disaster recovery</li>\n<li>Namespace and tenant isolation to manage secrets across multiple teams or business units</li>\n<li>Integrated HSM support for compliance-critical encryption</li>\n<li>Logging, monitoring, and security data needed for audits in one central place</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Building a foundation for the AI era</h2>\n\n<p>GEICO is currently in the middle of its five-year transformation, which includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Re-architecting six physical datacenters</li>\n<li>Overhauling 350 edge sites (regional offices and field agents)</li>\n<li>Migrating off bespoke mesh topologies without disrupting the 24/7 business</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Decoupling the network and most security functions made it possible to start doing this without major disruptions to the end users. The resulting efficiency so far has allowed GEICO to shift investment from \u2018keeping the lights on\u2019 to building value that makes their agents more effective and their customers' lives better.</p>\n\n<p>By standardizing identity, secrets, and access controls across environments, GEICO created the flexibility to place workloads where it made the most sense \u2014 based on cost, performance, or future needs like AI. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cPart of getting foundational identity security and network correct is to be able to enable your AI revolution. That was a critical element: how can we reduce our cost to serve and increase our portability, improve our data quality so that we can unlock AI to make our agents that much more effective, that much more productive?\u201d \u2014 Rebecca Weekly, VP, Infrastructure Engineering, GEICO</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At HashiCorp, we\u2019ve worked with thousands of organizations to help them through their digital transformations.

      "raw_content": "Over the last three quarters, the team at PlanetScale has focused on the dual goals of making open source Vitess easy to use and easy to contribute to. A part of this effort was a migration of all the integration tests written in Python to Go.\nThere were several reasons for this project:\nThe Python tests were very time-consuming to develop and debug.\nThe Python tests added additional install dependencies for anyone getting started as a contributor.\nSupport for the Python version being used (2.7) ended on January 1, 2020.\nThis was a fairly massive project that required several people working on it for almost four months. The project was started around November 1, 2019 and completed on February 25, 2020. There were 197 separate integration tests in 39 files that had to be migrated. In terms of LOC, it was over 24,000 lines of Python code.\nIn order to accomplish the migration, we first built a test framework in Go (using the command and testing packages) that allowed us to start a Vitess cluster and interact with it programmatically. The framework had to support running multiple tests in parallel without port conflicts; create non-conflicting working directories for all the relevant processes; log sufficient information to enable failure diagnosis, etc. Once that was done, it was a matter of translating Python tests into the equivalent Go code.\nAlong the way, we were also able to improve the CI pipeline for Vitess. While Travis CI has served us well over the years, we saw an opportunity to switch to GitHub actions. The advantages?\nLarger compute+memory instance types. While Travis CI (and Circle CI for that matter) will provide you with larger instances on paid plans, we really wanted to stay within the free tier so that contributors could run with the same technologies and experience as the core project. Larger sizes are important for Vitess, since the test suite can launch 6 or more instances of mysqld.\nNo limit of 5 concurrent jobs. We were using Travis matrix builds for a purpose they weren\u2019t designed for \u2014 to split 2 hrs and 30 minutes of testing into 5 \u201cshards\u201d of 30 minutes. That meant that we could only effectively have one concurrent job, and during peak periods there could be a delay of an hour or more to have test suite results. Our new GitHub actions configuration still uses shards, but now with over 14 of them. We are also no longer blocked by other developers running CI tasks at the same time.\nThe end result of the project is that it is now much easier and faster to develop new integration tests. It is also easier for someone new to the project to get started. The CI changes give us quicker feedback on pull requests and increase throughput on pull requests.\nTo learn more, join the Vitess Slack channel and attend the next monthly open meeting on Thursday, March 19 to hear Arindam Nayak talk about this project in detail. The meeting details can be found in the Vitess Slack channel.",

This is how we&rsquo;ll get our events into the Machine.</p>\n\n<p>When Lambdo creates a Machine, it places a file at <code>/tmp/events.json</code>.

Fly.io doesn&rsquo;t really care what you run, which is to our advantage. We can choose to write discreet functions per event, or we can bring our whole <a href=\"https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith/\" title=\"\">Majestic Monolith</a> to bear.</p>\n\n<p>How do we package up our code? The real answer is &ldquo;however you want!&rdquo;, but here&rsquo;s 2 ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"font-semibold text-navy-950\">Use Your Existing Code Base</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can just use your existing code base. This is especially easy if you&rsquo;re already deploying apps to Fly.io.</p>\n\n<p>All we&rsquo;d need to do is add some additional code - a command perhaps (<code>rake</code>, <code>artisan</code>, whatever) - that sucks in that JSON, iterates over the events, and does some stuff.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-wrapper group relative php\">\n  <button class=\"bubble-wrap z-20 absolute right-9 -mr-0.5 top-1.5 text-transparent group-hover:text-gray-400 group-hover:hocus:text-white focus:text-white bg-transparent group-hover:bg-gray-900 group-hover:hocus:bg-gray-700 focus:bg-gray-700 transition-colors grid place-items-center w-7 h-7 rounded-lg outline-none focus:outline-none\" type=\"button\">\n    <svg class=\"w-4 h-4 pointer-events-none\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.35\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><path d=\"M9.912 8.037h2.732c1.277 0 2.315-.962 2.315-2.237a2.325 2.325 0 00-2.315-2.31H2.959m10.228 9.01H2.959M6.802 8H2.959\"><path d=\"M11.081 6.466L9.533 8.037l1.548 1.571\"></g></svg>\n    <span class=\"bubble-sm bubble-tl [--offset-l:-9px] tail text-navy-950\">\n      Wrap text\n    </span>\n  </button>\n  <button class=\"bubble-wrap z-20 absolute right-1.5 top-1.5 text-transparent group-hover:text-gray-400 group-hover:hocus:text-white focus:text-white bg-transparent group-hover:bg-gray-900 group-hover:hocus:bg-gray-700 focus:bg-gray-700 transition-colors grid place-items-center w-7 h-7 rounded-lg outline-none focus:outline-none\" type=\"button\">\n    <svg class=\"w-4 h-4 pointer-events-none\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"1.35\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><path d=\"M10.576 7.239c0-.995-.82-1.815-1.815-1.815H3.315c-.995 0-1.815.82-1.815 1.815v5.446c0 .995.82 1.815 1.815 1.815h5.446c.995 0 1.815-.82 1.815-1.815V7.239z\"><path d=\"M10.576 10.577h2.109A1.825 1.825 0 0014.5 8.761V3.315A1.826 1.826 0 0012.685 1.5H7.239c-.996 0-1.815.819-1.816 1.815v1.617\"></g></svg>\n    <span class=\"bubble-sm bubble-tl [--offset-l:-6px] tail [--tail-x:calc(100%-30px)] text-navy-950\">\n      Copy to clipboard\n    </span>\n  </button>\n  <div class=\"highlight relative group\">\n    <pre class=\"highlight \"><code id=\"code-baprui6l\"><span class=\"nv\">$events</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">json_decode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">file_get_contents</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"/tmp/events.json\"</span><span class=\"p\">));</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">foreach</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">$events</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"nv\">$event</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// do a thing</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>When we create an event, we&rsquo;ll tell Lambdo how to run your code - more on that later.</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"font-semibold text-navy-950\">Use Lambdo&rsquo;s Base Images</strong></p>\n\n<p>This project also provides some &ldquo;runtimes&rdquo; (base images).

You have events, Fly.io has fast-booting VM&rsquo;s.

Our code can process those events any way we want.</p>\n\n<p>What I like about this approach is how flexible it can be. We can choose the base image to use and the server type (even using GPU-enabled Machines) <em>per event</em>.\nSince we have full control over the Machine VM&rsquo;s responding to the events, we can do whatever we want inside of them. Pretty neat!</p>",

But let&#x2019;s consider&#xa0;how this email even got sent to its target in the first place:</p><ul><li>An attacker slurped up lists of any public emails of 2008 political campaign staffers.</li><li>One 2008 staffer was&#xa0;<em>also</em>&#xa0;hired for the 2016 political campaign.</li><li>That particular staffer had non-public campaign emails in their address book, and one of them was a powerful key campaign member with an extensive email history.</li></ul><p>On successful phish leads to an even wider address book attack net down the line. Once they gain access to a person&#x2019;s inbox, they use it to prepare to their next attack. They&#x2019;ll harvest existing email addresses, subject lines, content, and attachments to construct plausible looking boobytrapped emails and mail them to all of&#xa0;<em>their</em>&#xa0;contacts. How sophisticated and targeted to a particular person this effort is determines whether it&#x2019;s so-called &#x201c;spear&#x201d; phishing or not.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"742\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/phishing-vs-spear-phishing.png\" width=\"1972\" /></figure><p>In this case is it was not at all targeted. This is a remarkably unsophisticated, absolutely generic routine phishing attack. There is zero focused attack effort on display here. But note the target did&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;immediately click the link in the email!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"989\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-hack-email-link-1.png\" width=\"1696\" /></figure><p>Instead, he did exactly what you&#x2019;d want a person to do in this scenario:&#xa0;<strong>he emailed IT support and asked if this email was valid.</strong>&#xa0;But IT made&#xa0;a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fatal mistake in their response</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-it-support-response.png\" width=\"1212\" /></figure><p>Do you see it? Here&#x2019;s the kicker:</p><blockquote>Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said&#xa0;<strong>he had meant to type that it was an &#x201c;illegitimate&#x201d; email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.</strong></blockquote><p>One word. He got&#xa0;<em>one</em>&#xa0;word wrong. But what a word to get wrong, and in the first sentence! The email did provide the proper Google address to reset your password. But the lede was already buried since the first sentence said &#x201c;legitimate;&#x201d; the phishing link in that email was then clicked. And the rest is literally history.</p><p>What&#x2019;s even funnier (well, in the way of gallows humor, I guess) is that public stats were left enabled for that bit.ly tracking link, so you can see exactly what crazy domain that &#x201c;Google login page&#x201d; resolved to, and that it was clicked exactly twice, on the same day it was mailed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"715\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/bitly-podesta-tracking-link.png\" width=\"1120\" /></figure><p>As I said, these were not exactly sophisticated attackers. So yeah, in&#xa0;<em>theory</em>&#xa0;an attentive user could pay attention to the browser&#x2019;s address bar and notice that after clicking the link, they arrived at</p><p><code>http://myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk/security/signinoptions/password</code></p><p>instead of</p><p><code>https://myaccount.google.com/security</code></p><p>Note that the phishing URL is carefully constructed so the most &#x201c;correct&#x201d; part is at the front, and weirdness is sandwiched in the middle. Unless you&#x2019;re paying very close attention and your address bar is long enough to expose the full URL, it&#x2019;s&#x2026; tricky.

These three short sentences are the 60 second summary of what you want to do, and what you want to share with others so&#xa0;<em>they</em>&#xa0;do, too.</p><p><strong>1) Enable Two Factor authentication through an app, and&#xa0;<em>not SMS</em>, everywhere you can.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"481\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/google-2fa-1.png\" width=\"566\" /></figure><p>Logging in with only a password, now matter how long and unique you attempt to make that password, will never be enough. A password is what you know; you need to add the second factor of something you&#xa0;<em>have</em>&#xa0;(or something you&#xa0;<em>are</em>) to achieve significant additional security. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SMS can famously&#xa0;be intercepted</a>, social engineered, or sim-jacked all too easily. If it&#x2019;s SMS, it&#x2019;s not secure,&#xa0;<em>period</em>. So install an authenticator app, and use it, at least for your most important credentials such as your email account and your bank.</p><p>Have I mentioned that Discourse&#xa0;added <a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2018/05/discourse-2-0-released/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two factor authentication support</a> in version 2.0, and our just released 2.1 adds printed backup codes, too? There are two paths forward: you can&#xa0;<em>talk</em>&#xa0;about the solution, or you can&#xa0;<em>build</em>&#xa0;the solution. I&#x2019;m trying to do both to the best of my ability. Look for the 2FA auth option in your user preferences on your favorite Discourse instance. It&#x2019;s there for you.</p><p>(This is also a company policy at Discourse; if you work here,&#xa0;<em>you 2FA everything all the time</em>. No other login option exists.)</p><p><strong>2) Make all your passwords 11 characters or more.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/hacker-hack-thyself/\">a long story</a>, but anything under 11 characters&#xa0;is basically the <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-password-is-too-damn-short/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">same as having no password</a> at all&#xa0;these days. I personally recommend at least 14 characters, maybe even 16. But this won&#x2019;t be a problem for you, because...</p><p><strong>3) Use a password manager.</strong></p><p>If you use a password manager, you can simultaneously avoid the pernicious danger of password re-use and&#xa0;the difficulty of coming up with <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/\">unique and random passwords</a>&#xa0;all the time. It is my hope in the long run that cloud based password management gets deeply built into Android, iOS, OSX, and Windows so that people don&#x2019;t need to run a weird m&#xe9;lange of third party apps to achieve this essential task. Password management is foundational and should not be the province of third parties on principle, because you never outsource a core competency.</p><p><strong>Bonus rule! For the particularly at-risk, get and use a U2F key.</strong></p><p>In the long term, two factor through an app isn&#x2019;t quite secure enough due to the very real (and growing) specter of real-time phishing. Authentication apps offer timed keys that expire after a minute or two, but if the attacker can get you to type an authentication key and relay it to the target site fast enough, they can still log in as you. If you need ultimate protection,&#xa0;look into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U2F keys</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/u2f-keys.jpg\" width=\"720\" /></figure><p>I believe U2F support is still too immature at the moment, particularly on mobile, for this to be practical for the average person right now. But if you do happen to fall into those groups that will be under attack, you&#xa0;<em>absolutely</em>&#xa0;want to set up U2F keys where you can today. They&#x2019;re cheap, and the good news is that they&#xa0;<em>literally make phishing impossible</em>&#xa0;at last. Given that Google had&#xa0;100% company-wide <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">success against phishing with U2F</a>, we know this works.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s world, computers are now so omnipresent that there is no longer any such thing as cybersecurity, online security, or computer security &#x2013; there&#x2019;s only&#xa0;<em>security</em>. You either have it, or you don&#x2019;t. If you follow and share these three rules, hopefully you too can have a modicum of security today.</p>",
