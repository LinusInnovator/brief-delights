It's the same exhilaration we get from roller coasters, but when you're in the driver's seat, you're in charge of the ride.</p>\n<p>When you're not expecting it, though, there's anxiety instead of excitement and, should the slide end with a crunch, a lot more negative emotions, too.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, fewer and fewer drivers will have to experience that kind of scare thanks to the proliferation and sophistication of modern electronic stability and traction control systems.

But let&#x2019;s consider&#xa0;how this email even got sent to its target in the first place:</p><ul><li>An attacker slurped up lists of any public emails of 2008 political campaign staffers.</li><li>One 2008 staffer was&#xa0;<em>also</em>&#xa0;hired for the 2016 political campaign.</li><li>That particular staffer had non-public campaign emails in their address book, and one of them was a powerful key campaign member with an extensive email history.</li></ul><p>On successful phish leads to an even wider address book attack net down the line. Once they gain access to a person&#x2019;s inbox, they use it to prepare to their next attack. They&#x2019;ll harvest existing email addresses, subject lines, content, and attachments to construct plausible looking boobytrapped emails and mail them to all of&#xa0;<em>their</em>&#xa0;contacts. How sophisticated and targeted to a particular person this effort is determines whether it&#x2019;s so-called &#x201c;spear&#x201d; phishing or not.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"742\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/phishing-vs-spear-phishing.png\" width=\"1972\" /></figure><p>In this case is it was not at all targeted. This is a remarkably unsophisticated, absolutely generic routine phishing attack. There is zero focused attack effort on display here. But note the target did&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;immediately click the link in the email!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"989\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-hack-email-link-1.png\" width=\"1696\" /></figure><p>Instead, he did exactly what you&#x2019;d want a person to do in this scenario:&#xa0;<strong>he emailed IT support and asked if this email was valid.</strong>&#xa0;But IT made&#xa0;a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fatal mistake in their response</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-it-support-response.png\" width=\"1212\" /></figure><p>Do you see it? Here&#x2019;s the kicker:</p><blockquote>Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said&#xa0;<strong>he had meant to type that it was an &#x201c;illegitimate&#x201d; email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.</strong></blockquote><p>One word. He got&#xa0;<em>one</em>&#xa0;word wrong. But what a word to get wrong, and in the first sentence! The email did provide the proper Google address to reset your password. But the lede was already buried since the first sentence said &#x201c;legitimate;&#x201d; the phishing link in that email was then clicked. And the rest is literally history.</p><p>What&#x2019;s even funnier (well, in the way of gallows humor, I guess) is that public stats were left enabled for that bit.ly tracking link, so you can see exactly what crazy domain that &#x201c;Google login page&#x201d; resolved to, and that it was clicked exactly twice, on the same day it was mailed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"715\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/bitly-podesta-tracking-link.png\" width=\"1120\" /></figure><p>As I said, these were not exactly sophisticated attackers. So yeah, in&#xa0;<em>theory</em>&#xa0;an attentive user could pay attention to the browser&#x2019;s address bar and notice that after clicking the link, they arrived at</p><p><code>http://myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk/security/signinoptions/password</code></p><p>instead of</p><p><code>https://myaccount.google.com/security</code></p><p>Note that the phishing URL is carefully constructed so the most &#x201c;correct&#x201d; part is at the front, and weirdness is sandwiched in the middle. Unless you&#x2019;re paying very close attention and your address bar is long enough to expose the full URL, it&#x2019;s&#x2026; tricky.

These three short sentences are the 60 second summary of what you want to do, and what you want to share with others so&#xa0;<em>they</em>&#xa0;do, too.</p><p><strong>1) Enable Two Factor authentication through an app, and&#xa0;<em>not SMS</em>, everywhere you can.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"481\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/google-2fa-1.png\" width=\"566\" /></figure><p>Logging in with only a password, now matter how long and unique you attempt to make that password, will never be enough. A password is what you know; you need to add the second factor of something you&#xa0;<em>have</em>&#xa0;(or something you&#xa0;<em>are</em>) to achieve significant additional security. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SMS can famously&#xa0;be intercepted</a>, social engineered, or sim-jacked all too easily. If it&#x2019;s SMS, it&#x2019;s not secure,&#xa0;<em>period</em>. So install an authenticator app, and use it, at least for your most important credentials such as your email account and your bank.</p><p>Have I mentioned that Discourse&#xa0;added <a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2018/05/discourse-2-0-released/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two factor authentication support</a> in version 2.0, and our just released 2.1 adds printed backup codes, too? There are two paths forward: you can&#xa0;<em>talk</em>&#xa0;about the solution, or you can&#xa0;<em>build</em>&#xa0;the solution. I&#x2019;m trying to do both to the best of my ability. Look for the 2FA auth option in your user preferences on your favorite Discourse instance. It&#x2019;s there for you.</p><p>(This is also a company policy at Discourse; if you work here,&#xa0;<em>you 2FA everything all the time</em>. No other login option exists.)</p><p><strong>2) Make all your passwords 11 characters or more.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/hacker-hack-thyself/\">a long story</a>, but anything under 11 characters&#xa0;is basically the <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-password-is-too-damn-short/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">same as having no password</a> at all&#xa0;these days. I personally recommend at least 14 characters, maybe even 16. But this won&#x2019;t be a problem for you, because...</p><p><strong>3) Use a password manager.</strong></p><p>If you use a password manager, you can simultaneously avoid the pernicious danger of password re-use and&#xa0;the difficulty of coming up with <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/\">unique and random passwords</a>&#xa0;all the time. It is my hope in the long run that cloud based password management gets deeply built into Android, iOS, OSX, and Windows so that people don&#x2019;t need to run a weird m&#xe9;lange of third party apps to achieve this essential task. Password management is foundational and should not be the province of third parties on principle, because you never outsource a core competency.</p><p><strong>Bonus rule! For the particularly at-risk, get and use a U2F key.</strong></p><p>In the long term, two factor through an app isn&#x2019;t quite secure enough due to the very real (and growing) specter of real-time phishing. Authentication apps offer timed keys that expire after a minute or two, but if the attacker can get you to type an authentication key and relay it to the target site fast enough, they can still log in as you. If you need ultimate protection,&#xa0;look into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U2F keys</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/u2f-keys.jpg\" width=\"720\" /></figure><p>I believe U2F support is still too immature at the moment, particularly on mobile, for this to be practical for the average person right now. But if you do happen to fall into those groups that will be under attack, you&#xa0;<em>absolutely</em>&#xa0;want to set up U2F keys where you can today. They&#x2019;re cheap, and the good news is that they&#xa0;<em>literally make phishing impossible</em>&#xa0;at last. Given that Google had&#xa0;100% company-wide <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">success against phishing with U2F</a>, we know this works.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s world, computers are now so omnipresent that there is no longer any such thing as cybersecurity, online security, or computer security &#x2013; there&#x2019;s only&#xa0;<em>security</em>. You either have it, or you don&#x2019;t. If you follow and share these three rules, hopefully you too can have a modicum of security today.</p>",

Non-human identities (NHIs) \u2014 service accounts, API keys, OAuth tokens, certificates, and machine credentials \u2014 now vastly outnumber human users in most organizations, yet we're still managing them with approaches designed for people.</p>\n\n<h2>The NHI problem: Static secrets at scale</h2>\n\n<p>The explosion of microservices, containerized workloads, and cloud-native architecture has created an <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/the-unseen-risk-securing-nhis-in-your-infrastructure\">NHI crisis</a>. A typical Kubernetes cluster might contain hundreds of pods, each requiring credentials to access:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Databases</li>\n<li>Message queues</li>\n<li>Object storage</li>\n<li>External APIs, etc. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Multiply this across development, staging, and production environments, then add: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CI/CD pipelines</li>\n<li>Monitoring agents</li>\n<li>Backup services</li>\n<li>Infrastructure automation tools, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At this point, you're managing thousands or tens of thousands of non-human identities.</p>\n\n<p>Static secrets are the Achilles' heel of this architecture. This could be\u2026 </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A database password embedded in an environment variable</li>\n<li>The AWS access key in your Terraform state file</li>\n<li>The service account JSON sitting in a mounted volume</li>\n<li>And countless other things</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These long-lived credentials represent <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/why-we-need-short-lived-credentials-and-how-to-adopt-them\">persistent attack surfaces</a>. When a static secret is compromised, attackers gain access until someone manually rotates it, assuming the breach is even detected. The <a href=\"https://circleci.com/blog/jan-4-2023-incident-report/\">CircleCI breach of 2023</a> is a classic example, where compromised OAuth tokens and credentials stored in their systems gave attackers potential access to thousands of customer environments.</p>\n\n<p>The operational burden is equally problematic. Manual credential rotation is error-prone and rarely happens on schedule. Tracking where secrets are used becomes impossible as infrastructure scales. When you need to revoke access, can you confidently identify every location where a particular API key or certificate is deployed? The answer in most organizations is \u201cno,\u201d leading to the accumulation of zombie credentials that persist indefinitely because teams are worried about breaking unknown dependencies.</p>\n\n<h2>Passwordless authentication for humans: Setting the foundation</h2>\n\n<p>Before diving into a deeper discussion of NHI solutions, it's worth noting that human identity management is also evolving rapidly. Technologies like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn\">WebAuthn</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO_Alliance#FIDO2\">FIDO2</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.passkeys.com/what-are-passkeys\">passkeys</a> are eliminating passwords for end users, using public-key cryptography and biometric authentication to provide phishing-resistant authentication. While this represents significant progress for human users, the more complex challenge lies in securing the non-human authentication that powers modern infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h2>Workload identity: Eliminating static secrets for NHIs</h2>\n\n<p>The most promising development in NHI management is the shift toward <em>workload identity</em>: treating non-human identities as first-class citizens with dynamically issued, short-lived credentials. Rather than distributing and managing static secrets, workload identity systems leverage the infrastructure itself to establish identity and issue temporary credentials.</p>\n\n<p>Cloud providers have led this evolution. AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA), Azure Managed Identities, and Google Cloud Workload Identity allow workloads to authenticate based on their execution context rather than embedded secrets. A pod running in Kubernetes can assume an IAM role and receive temporary credentials that expire in minutes or hours, never requiring a static access key to be stored anywhere. The infrastructure attests to the workload's identity, and credentials are vended just-in-time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/service-mesh\">Service meshes</a> extend this concept to service-to-service communication, automatically issuing and rotating<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/system/files/inline-files/An_Overview_of_x.509_certificates.pdf\"> X.509 certificates</a> through<a href=\"https://spiffe.io/\"> SPIFFE/SPIRE</a> implementations. Every service gets a cryptographically verifiable identity, and mutual TLS happens transparently without developers managing certificates. When implemented properly, no service ever needs to handle a long-lived secret.</p>\n\n<p>The practical implications are significant: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your CI/CD pipeline authenticates to your cloud provider using <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nitesh_17214/the-future-of-identity-openid-connect-federation-1-0-c5ed937bbd40\">OIDC federation</a>, receiving temporary credentials scoped to exactly what that pipeline run needs. </li>\n<li>Your application pods never see database passwords. They authenticate using their workload identity and receive time-limited access tokens. </li>\n<li>When you decommission a service, its identity disappears with it, automatically revoking access without manual cleanup.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Secrets management for the transition period</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the promise of workload identity, <em>complete elimination</em> of static secrets remains aspirational for most organizations. </p>\n\n<p>The reality is that most organizations use legacy systems, third-party SaaS APIs, and databases that don't support <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/why-we-need-dynamic-secrets\">dynamic credentials</a>. This means having to manage some static secrets for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n<p>The question is how to do it safely.</p>\n\n<p>Modern secrets management has evolved from simple encrypted key-value stores to platforms that enforce least-privilege access and automate rotation. <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_future-of-secrets-identity-mgmt-blog_PRODUCTPAGE&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=product_page\">HashiCorp Vault</a> pioneered many of these patterns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic secrets generation for databases and cloud providers</li>\n<li>Leasing and renewal mechanisms</li>\n<li>Detailed audit logging, etc. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Vault can also easily integrate with cloud-native secret managers like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Google Secret Manager for more centralized visibility and control in a multi-cloud environment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The critical capabilities for contemporary secrets management include:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automated rotation with rollback capabilities</li>\n<li>Just-in-time access provisioning where secrets are injected at runtime rather than stored in configuration</li>\n<li>Policy-based access control that restricts which workloads can access which secrets</li>\n<li>Comprehensive audit trails showing exactly when and by whom secrets were accessed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Integration with CI/CD pipelines is also essential. Secrets should be pulled during deployment and injected as environment variables or mounted volumes, <em>never</em> committed to repositories or stored in pipeline definitions.</p>\n\n<p>For organizations still distributing secrets manually or storing them in configuration management systems, the path forward involves: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/on-demand/12-things-a-modern-secrets-management-solution-must-do?utm_source=hashicorp.com&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_future-of-secrets-identity-mgmt-blog_WHITEPAPER&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=whitepaper\">Consolidating secrets</a> into a dedicated management platform</li>\n<li>Automating injection into workloads</li>\n<li>Implementing <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/rotated-vs-dynamic-secrets-which-should-you-use\">rotation policies</a></li>\n<li>Progressively migrating to dynamic credentials where possible</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a multi-year journey for most organizations, so it\u2019s important to adopt a realistic perspective, which means accepting that you'll operate in a hybrid state for some time.</p>\n\n<h2>Zero trust architecture: Continuous verification for NHIs</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/introduction-to-zero-trust-security\">Zero trust principles</a> apply as much to NHIs as to human users. The castle-and-moat model of &quot;authenticate once at the perimeter and trust thereafter&quot; has proven inadequate in environments where lateral movement and privilege escalation are primary attack vectors. For NHIs, zero trust means <strong>continuous validation of identity, context, and authorization</strong> throughout a request lifecycle.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/policies\">Policy engines</a> and cloud-native authorization services enable fine-grained, context-aware access control. Rather than binary &quot;can this service account access this resource&quot; decisions, policies can incorporate factors like: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Requesting a workload's namespace</li>\n<li>Time of day</li>\n<li>Sensitivity of the requested data</li>\n<li>Security posture of the underlying infrastructure</li>\n<li>and more</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A database query from a production namespace might be allowed, while the identical query from a developer's laptop is denied.</p>\n\n<p>Implementing zero trust for NHIs requires infrastructure that can continuously verify workload identity and provide contextual mapping to policy engines. Service meshes excel here, embedding identity and policy enforcement directly in the data path. Every request carries verifiable identity information, and authorization decisions happen at microsecond latency, making fine-grained control practical even in high-throughput environments.</p>\n\n<h2>Observability and detection: Knowing your blast radius</h2>\n\n<p>You can't secure what you can't see. One of the most significant challenges in NHI management is simply maintaining an inventory of NHIs and understanding their access patterns. Most organizations discover they have far more service accounts, API keys, and machine credentials than they realized when they attempt comprehensive enumeration.</p>\n\n<p>Modern credential management requires continuous discovery and monitoring. This means having tools that <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault/hcp-vault-radar?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_afuture-of-secrets-identity-mgmt-blog_PRODUCTPAGE&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=product_page\">scan repositories for leaked secrets</a> and tools that can <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/products/verify-identity-protection\">inventory cloud IAM roles and service accounts</a>. These platforms discover hidden API keys, passwords, and machine identities across entire infrastructures, enabling organizations to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Map dependencies between services and credentials</li>\n<li>Identify migration candidates ready for managed identity transformation</li>\n<li>Assess risks associated with current secret usage and triage exposed secrets</li>\n<li>Plan strategic migrations rather than blind transformations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Detection of anomalous NHI behavior is equally critical. It\u2019s important to be able to identify unusual activity, such as: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A service account accessing resources outside its typical scope</li>\n<li>Authentication from unexpected network locations</li>\n<li>Sudden spikes in API usage, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unlike human behavior, machine workloads tend to be highly predictable, making anomaly detection particularly effective for NHIs. For example, if your batch processing service starts making database queries at noon instead of 2 a.m., or your CI/CD service account suddenly accesses production resources, these represent unusual activities worth investigating.</p>\n\n<h2>The road ahead: Practical steps for technical leaders</h2>\n\n<p>The transformation from static secrets to workload identity represents a multi-year journey that requires coordinated effort across development, operations, and security teams. For technical decision makers charting this path, several strategic priorities emerge.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Establish workload identity as the default for new services.</strong> Cloud-native workloads should leverage native identity services from day one rather than falling back to static credentials out of familiarity or perceived simplicity. The initial investment in understanding IAM roles, service accounts, and OIDC federation pays dividends immediately and avoids accumulating technical debt that must be remediated later.</li>\n<li><strong>Implement <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/5-best-practices-for-secrets-management\">comprehensive secrets management</a> for existing static credentials.</strong> Consolidating secrets into a centralized platform with automated rotation and access policies provides immediate security benefits and brings visibility into your secret footprint, helping you to prioritize which systems to migrate to dynamic credentials.</li>\n<li><strong>Make <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/what-are-non-human-identities-nhi-and-who-owns-their-security\">NHI governance</a> a priority.</strong> Implement processes for provisioning, reviewing, and decommissioning non-human identities with the same discipline applied to human accounts. Periodic access reviews should include service accounts and API keys, not just user permissions. Automated discovery and inventory management should feed into your security operations, providing visibility into the true scope of your NHI footprint.</li>\n<li><strong>Invest in observability for NHI behavior.</strong> Understanding normal patterns enables anomaly detection. Comprehensive audit logging of credential usage provides both security monitoring and compliance evidence. The ability to answer &quot;which services accessed this resource and when&quot; is foundational to incident response and forensics.</li>\n<li><strong>Embrace federation and standards.</strong> OIDC, OAuth 2.0, SPIFFE, and other open standards enable interoperability and reduce vendor lock-in. As identity moves increasingly toward distributed, heterogeneous environments spanning multiple clouds and on-premises infrastructure, standards-based approaches will be essential to maintaining consistent security policies.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The future of credential and identity management for NHIs is going to require automation, discovery, and visibility. Organizations that lead us into this future will make workload identity the default. Their secrets will rotate themselves, and when policy enforcement happens transparently in the infrastructure layer, security will stop being a manual process prone to human error. Gradually, security will become a property of the architecture itself.</p>\n\n<p>That future is achievable today for new cloud native workloads, and it represents the target state for existing infrastructure. The important point for technical leaders to understand is that this evolution won\u2019t be done in isolation. Secrets management, identity management, secure access \u2014 these all need to become threads in the larger fabric of a <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/infrastructure-cloud?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_MULTI_RISK_future-of-secrets-identity-mgmt-blog_WEBSITE&amp;utm_content=conclusion-cta&amp;utm_offer=website\">unified platform</a>, tying together the software delivery pipeline from CI/CD, to infrastructure provisioning, to workload orchestration. </p>",

      "raw_content": "<p>The mandate to leverage data and AI for operational gain is forcing businesses to reckon with growing complexity in their IT infrastructure. As a result, leaders are now asking: What is hybrid cloud, and what role will it play in our company\u2019s future?</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, companies rely on a mix of public and private cloud infrastructure services, as well as systems they own and operate themselves. Done right, this hybrid architecture lets organizations connect on-premises solutions that still support mission-critical workflows to the growing number of cloud-based systems, while also enabling quicker and more seamless access to AI, edge computing, and other frontier technology \u2014 all while maintaining strong, consistent security across the entire IT landscape.</p>\n\n<p>But many struggle to achieve these benefits. For 52% of businesses, hybrid cloud is a top infrastructure management challenge, according to the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/cloud-complexity-report?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_BDM_MULTI_hybrid-cloud-explained-blog&amp;utm_content=intro-blog-link&amp;utm_offer=ccr\">2025 Cloud Complexity Survey</a>. Often, cloud and on-premises systems aren't connected. They\u2019re typically managed in silos, creating gaps that slow down developers, increase risk, and lead to unexpected costs. Security and infrastructure specialists don\u2019t communicate as much as they should. And instead of AI-driven automation, platform teams and developers continue to do much of their work manually.</p>\n\n<p>Without a unified lifecycle approach to hybrid cloud management, enterprises could find themselves falling short in their data and AI priorities in 2026. However, when infrastructure is managed through one control plane as a single architecture, infrastructure becomes a catalyst for faster, more impactful innovation.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll outline what\u2019s needed for an effective hybrid cloud strategy, and explain how a unified lifecycle approach can accelerate, strengthen, and optimize infrastructure management.</p>\n\n<h2>Building the right hybrid cloud</h2>\n\n<p>The hybrid model is quickly becoming a common architecture choice. In fact, by 2027, an estimated 90% of organizations will use a hybrid cloud, <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-11-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-total-723-billion-dollars-in-2025\">according to Gartner</a>. Why is it becoming popular?</p>\n\n<h3>Why is a hybrid cloud important?</h3>\n\n<p>On-premises systems often hold some of a company\u2019s most valuable data, and play a pivotal role in core workflows \u2014 particularly for regulated industries that must protect sensitive and confidential information. Some companies will find it safer or less expensive to keep some data managed in house and on-prem. But that data will also become key context for AI in the coming months and years. Now, as more enterprises aim to use AI to automate processes and improve deduction-making, among other outcomes, it\u2019s imperative that businesses minimize gaps between their on-prem and cloud technology.</p>\n\n<h3>Hybrid cloud vs. multi-cloud</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Hybrid cloud</strong> is defined as any infrastructure that uses both cloud (regardless of whether it\u2019s public and/or private) and on-premises dedicated datacenters. <strong>Multi-cloud</strong> is defined as any infrastructure that uses more than one cloud vendor or system (regardless of whether it\u2019s public and/or private, self-built, or from a third-party). Organizations can have both hybrid cloud and multi-cloud infrastructure simultaneously, which is not uncommon.</p>\n\n<p>The hybrid cloud management challenge is similar to the multi-cloud management challenge. Siloed teams and workflows cause massive levels of friction when new software innovations need to harness multiple environments, and companies need to secure and manage all those environments efficiently.</p>\n\n<h3>Why hybrid cloud requires a unified lifecycle approach to infrastructure</h3>\n\n<p>Organizations with hybrid cloud environments understand how challenging this infrastructure can be. Adrian Cockcroft, who once led the open source program at Netflix, compared hybrid cloud management to one rider riding two horses.</p>\n\n<p>Teams that want to start addressing runaway infrastructure costs and growing inefficiency need to focus on that \u201cone rider\u201d as the key leverage point for fixing their problems. To do that, organizations need to build a <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/infrastructure-cloud?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_BDM_SPEED_hybrid-cloud-explained-blog_WEBSITE&amp;utm_content=mid-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=website\">unified platform</a> as a foundation that will allow software teams to \u201cride multiple horses\u201d without noticing a difference in speed or process friction.</p>\n\n<p>A unified lifecycle approach to security and infrastructure management that eliminates barriers across hybrid infrastructure requires several components, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An infrastructure as code approach to infrastructure and policy to deliver consistency across environments</li>\n<li>Self-service provisioning to remove complexity for developers</li>\n<li>Identity-based access, with centralized secrets management to shift the business from long-lived to short-lived credentials, API keys, and other sensitive secrets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Doing hybrid cloud right</h2>\n\n<p>Hybrid cloud complexity is more than an IT problem; it can drag down the whole business.</p>\n\n<p>Without a unified view across the entire infrastructure landscape, it\u2019s harder and more time-consuming for platform teams to spot vulnerabilities or troubleshoot issues, leading to higher costs and worse performance. Similarly, without standardized policies and processes, developers take an ad hoc approach to building software that leads to an exploding number of security gaps and reliability issues.</p>\n\n<p>A unified lifecycle approach to hybrid cloud management transforms how platform teams operate to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Accelerate innovation - by removing manual, time-consuming aspects of infrastructure management and provisioning.</li>\n<li>Strengthen security - with an identity-based zero trust operating model, spanning an organization\u2019s human and non-human entities.</li>\n<li>Optimize spend - with real-time visibility and cost controls to proactively detect issues before they lead to larger monthly bills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n\n<p>To learn more about how we can help your company navigate the complexities of hybrid infrastructure for more secure, automated operations, check out our new <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/do-cloud-right-explained?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal-blog&amp;utm_campaign=26Q1_WW_BDM_MULTI_hybrid-cloud-explained-blog_WEBSITE&amp;utm_content=end-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=website\"><em>Do Cloud Right, Explained</em></a> video series and <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/contact-sales?utm_source=hashicorp&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=26Q3_WW_PRACTITIONER_RISK_rethinking-ssh-blog_CONTACTSALES&amp;utm_content=end-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=contactsales\">drop us a line</a> to talk about your unique IT challenges.</p>",

But what if those complaints are actually a practical source of innovation? In other words, what about treating complaints as an early-warning system and a free R&amp;D lab?</p>\n<p>This approach has been in place at the Vaud University Hospital (CHUV) in Switzerland for over a decade. Rather than sidelining grievances, leaders analyze them, learn from them, and implement fundamental changes. They don\u2019t downplay criticisms; instead, they use feedback as building blocks for making improvements. This is a model that organizations in other industries could also benefit from implementing.</p>\n<p>To complement other quality-surveillance tools, such as customer satisfaction surveys, CHUV leaders began collecting <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/CAT.24.0238\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">complaints at a mediation center at the hospital</a>. The entire customer experience is reflected in those complaints, which are rigorously filed and coded and have surfaced cross-silo breakdowns and uncertainty along with other issues. They cover aspects of customers\u2019 personal experiences (and those of employees as well) but are likely to reflect difficulties that hundreds of other people are at risk of encountering. </p>\n<p>Take, for example, the CHUV patient whose testimony led to the correction of a malfunction in the cancellation and rescheduling of surgical appointments. The customer had been discharged from the hospital after an operation and erroneously received a call the next day informing him that he was going to have surgery the following week. This call caused excessive and preventable anxiety because of the questions it raised for the patient: Did the doctors operate on the wrong person? Do I have a complication? This account led the department involved to review its entire process for scheduling surgical appointments and to install clear verification checkpoints to prevent other patients from experiencing the same miscommunication.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Over a 29-month period from 2021 to 2024, CHUV developed 17 projects based on testimonials from patients, relatives, and professionals. Projects ranged from reducing wait times for elderly patients to improving the information-sharing process for families experiencing a tragic event. </p>\n<p>Those examples highlight a simple truth: When complaints are treated as data, not disruptions, organizations can respond more quickly, learn more, and improve their services. Concretely, this reframes \u201cquality\u201d from a metric that just measures outcomes to one that takes into account reliability and trust. </p>\n<h3>Beyond Clinical Excellence: Learning From Hospitality</h3>\n<p>Identifying problems is only half the battle. Solving them requires new skills and, in many cases, a new mindset. For CHUV, that meant partnering with the EHL Hospitality Business School, also in Lausanne, to develop a cross-industry training program beginning in 2021. The goal was to equip health care professionals with the service expertise that the hospitality sector has been honing for decades. The program focuses on service design, social skills, and patient experience \u2014 all skills that would benefit from being further developed in traditional clinical curricula.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The logic is simple. Although patients evaluate the quality of their care based partly on clinical outcomes, their perceptions are also shaped by their service experience \u2014 how they are welcomed, informed, and supported. In competitive health markets, these \u201cnontechnical\u201d moments can tip the balance between loyalty and attrition. Most clinical training programs partially touch on these interactions, but such skills are no longer nice-to-haves. They are a strategic differentiator.</p>\n<p>The program was codesigned by a hospitality management specialist from EHL (Lohyd Terrier) and a public health professional from CHUV (B\u00e9atrice Schaad Noble). Its primary objective was to apply EHL\u2019s expertise in hospitality to the hospital\u2019s operational requirements to help preserve the institution\u2019s capacity for hospitality amid the growing <a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-nursing-shortage-shows-why-industries-must-choose-tech-carefully/\">technologization of medicine</a> and the tendency for digitalization to progressively turn patients into data.</p>\n<p>By sending staff members from departments exposed to external competition, such as elective surgery or maternity care, to short, hospitality-focused courses, CHUV hoped to strengthen its competitive advantage by giving employees time to develop ways to enhance service quality. In a <a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-solve-nursing-crisis/\">field that has to constantly battle staff burnout</a> and talent shortages, equipping employees with tools to improve the patient experience had the potential to enhance their own experience and well-being as well. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the most revealing examples of this approach emerged when staff members in the training program critically examined the old adage \u201cno news is good news,\u201d a common but problematic mantra in clinical environments. For clinicians, not calling patients whose lab results were normal seemed efficient \u2014 a way to avoid unnecessary calls and paperwork \u2014 yet it also created a sense of discomfort for patients, given the uncertainty the silence could generate. Indeed, from the patient\u2019s perspective, silence bred anxiety: Was something wrong? Was their file lost? How long should they wait before picking up the phone to ask?</p>\n<p>Through joint workshops, clinical and administrative teams codesigned a new process that allows patients to indicate how and when they would prefer to receive test results. Those who prefer email notifications receive timely updates electronically. Those who prefer face-to-face discussions continue to schedule appointments with their physicians. This modest change helped to reduce patient uncertainty and lift the moral burden staff members felt when they weren\u2019t allowed to share the updates patients were asking for. The operational move is simple; the effect on trust is huge.</p>\n<p>After just a few days of training, most participants demonstrated a higher level of confidence in their ability to improve the patient experience. That confidence accelerated small tests of changes and wins across units.</p>\n<p>An ethos of collaboration started to take hold across services at CHUV. In a dialysis unit grappling with high staff turnover and patient frustration, teams recognized that an unspoken culture or mistaken beliefs about the concept of professionalism penalized professionals for seeking help. Nurses who were having trouble inserting a needle and wanted to pass the task to a colleague worried that they might be judged incompetent \u2014 so they self-censored instead of asking for assistance. By reframing the handoff as an act of collaborative care rather than a sign of weakness, staff members reduced tension and improved patient trust. </p>\n<p>These are small but profound shifts. They demonstrate how inviting front-line staff members to reimagine service delivery can yield tangible and lasting improvements and eventually reduce conflicts with patients and their relatives. To date, more than 200 professionals have completed the joint program. They have developed more than 20 improvement projects and now report higher job satisfaction, confidence, and motivation.</p>\n<h3>Three Steps For Using Customer Feedback Better</h3>\n<p>The collaboration between CHUV and EHL suggests that learning from other industries and listening to customers can re-anchor an organization in empathy and shared purpose. And the stakes for this type of analysis and innovation have never been higher. In the medical field in Switzerland alone, 34% of medical students said they considered leaving the field after their first internship. Burnout, loss of meaning, and relentless administrative pressure are pushing health care professionals out of the field worldwide. But professionals across all industries are feeling a <a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-burnout-age-real-pain-requires-real-solutions/\">similar weight from burnout</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are three steps any organization can take to realize the advantages of customer feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Treat complaints as assets, not noise.</strong> Stop dismissing grievances as distractions. Integrate the perspectives of customers and professionals in a systematic way. Because they directly experience situations as participants, these actors detect dysfunctions that traditional quality-monitoring tools may overlook. Listen to them through voluntary interviews \u2014 for example, in a mediation center or the office of the organization\u2019s chief experience officer \u2014 to collect the lived experiences that reveal real needs and expectations. Look for patterns that may indicate cross-department friction \u2014 something surveys are unlikely to surface. Link each issue to a process, and prioritize fixes that will have an outsize impact. This approach may require a cultural shift: Criticism or complaints should not be interpreted as signs of individual weakness but as opportunities to identify areas for enhancing quality and even safety.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>2. Redesign processes <em>with</em> customers, not for them.</strong> Codevelop initiatives based on expressed dissatisfaction. Using oral accounts from customers and professionals to design joint improvement projects creates genuine opportunities for collaboration, so invite customers into solution workshops. Encourage front-line teams to run small experiments, and double down on what works. Make feedback the engine of continuous improvement rather than the end point of a complaint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>3. Borrow expertise from other industries.</strong> Work with sectors known for service excellence \u2014 such as hospitality \u2014 to sharpen service design and communication, and to find better ways to manage uncertainty. Provide teams with short, targeted upskilling sessions that give them practical tools for solving problems creatively. Dedicate time for employee learning and training: Prioritizing teaching and brainstorming can enhance both trust with customers and staff morale.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This process for addressing customer complaints is not about bringing five-star hotel amenities to organizational offerings. Instead, it\u2019s about adopting the mindset that every interaction is an opportunity to build goodwill and reduce uncertainty. When complaints are treated as early warnings rather than irritations, they reveal systemic friction that customers feel but companies often don\u2019t see.</p>\n<p>This is a lesson that any organization can apply. Customers\u2019 frustrations are not simply a \u201ccost of doing business.\u201d They are blueprints for building something better. Treat them that way.</p>\n<p></p>",

Every employee depends on it, every system flows through it, and almost every operational challenge eventually becomes an IT problem. When IT slows down, everyone feels it: employees are blocked waiting on support, onboarding is painful, rolling out new tools gets bottlenecked, and entire company initiatives end up stalled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet despite IT\u2019s central role, the last decade of tooling has not truly empowered them. The powerful tools are heavy to set up and brittle to maintain; the easy-to-use tools focus on narrow use cases and deflection rather than true automation. IT teams are eager to automate and are more technical than business users. They have experimented with scripts, workflow builders, and more, but the limitations of all these tools still force them to spend the majority of their time on manual work, preventing them from focusing on higher-impact work and enabling the rest of their organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jake and Alex, the co-founders of <a href=\"https://www.serval.com/\">Serval</a>, experienced this firsthand at Verkada, where they led Product and Engineering and sold primarily to IT teams. They heard the same half-joking request countless times, and it wasn\u2019t about Verkada\u2019s products. They would ask customers, \u201cWhat else can we build for you?\u201d and IT leaders would reply, \u201cCan you fix my helpdesk too?\u201d These conversations led them to two key insights:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The first was that true automation only works if it is faster to automate something forever than to do it manually once.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The second came from watching the few IT leaders who did take the time to build automations. They would first describe the workflow in one simple sentence, then reveal a sprawling tree of branches, nodes, conditions, and edge cases. Jake and Alex wondered: what if you could actually build the entire automation the same way you describe it? What if one simple sentence truly was enough?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These insights were not possible to execute on in the past. Prior generations of AI were not strong enough to make it work, which meant IT teams continued working through manual tasks. That has now changed. With modern LLMs, code generation, and reasoning capabilities, it is finally possible to build a platform where \u201cautomate forever\u201d is faster than \u201cfix once.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Serval is built precisely to deliver on this, and the team is not stopping there. They are using this moment not only to build a system of automation, but to rethink the entire ITSM system of record. As our own Sequoia IT leader, Leon, shared when they chose to become a Serval customer: \u201cServal is not AI for ITSM \u2013 it is ITSM built from AI.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of the platform is an AI automation engine that lets teams go from a simple sentence to a deployment-ready automation. IT can describe workflows in natural language, then refine them further &#8211; either in natural language or all the way down to code when needed. This combination of being simple enough for anyone to use, yet deep enough for the most advanced IT builders, has resonated strongly with customers. The workflows are fully explainable and traceable, with all necessary permissions included, giving IT teams complete visibility and control and eliminating hallucination risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While their automation engine integrates with existing systems of records, Serval has also built a full-fledged ITSM platform, including a ticketing system, an access management product, an asset management solution, and more. Serval is both the system of engagement and the system of record. This gives IT a single place to build and orchestrate automations, enforce security and compliance, and capture the data that compounds their automation over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer feedback has been exceptional. We consistently heard how easy Serval is to use, yet how powerful, traceable, and trustworthy its automations are in practice. IT leaders described day-to-day operations being transformed &#8211; automation percentages rising every week, employee satisfaction increasing, and IT teams finally having the bandwidth to tackle projects that had been stuck on the back burner for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was also exceptional, and, to be perfectly honest, not something we expected to hear at this stage:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Many customers have already fully ripped and replaced incumbent ITSM tools and now use Serval as their system of record.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automation quickly spread beyond IT into HR, Finance, Legal, Engineering, Security, and more. In some cases, companies have churned off dedicated software vendors for some departments because they rebuilt their workflows directly in Serval.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>At Sequoia, the last time we heard such customer feedback that supports the thesis of IT system of record empowering horizontal enterprise automation was 16 years ago, when we partnered with ServiceNow. That is why we were so eager to partner with Serval and preempt their Series B round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market thesis is one half of the story. The other half is the team. References for Jake and Alex &#8211; from managers, direct reports, and peers &#8211; were glowing. Even more importantly, those references aligned perfectly with the evidence we heard from customers and what we\u2019ve observed in talent flows. Strong talent from R&amp;D to GTM is choosing to join Serval, whether or not they have worked with the founders before. The talent density and \u201cpotential energy\u201d forming around the company are impressive and represent one of the strongest leading indicators we look for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empowering IT teams is an elegant and scalable way to bring AI automation to the enterprise. We are excited to partner with Jake, Alex, and the team at Serval on this journey.</p>\n</section>\n\n\n<section class=\"social-sharing\">\n\t<div class=\"social-sharing__container\">\n\t\t<h2
