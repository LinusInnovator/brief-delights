      "raw_content": "<p>New threats emerge every week, and many vendors respond with narrow, new reactive cybersecurity tool purchases to make sure a specific incident <em>never happens again</em>. The result? Tool sprawl. Some organizations now rely on anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.securus360.com/blog/so-many-cybersecurity-tools-deployed#:%7E:text=Businesses%20typically%20deploy%2045%20cybersecurity,ability%20to%20contain%20active%20attacks.\">45</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/unified-cybersecurity-platform\">83</a> separate cybersecurity tools. </p>\n\n<p>This fragmented approach drives up costs, complicates workflows, and (believe it or not) actually increases risk and makes you less secure due to poor integration and limited visibility.</p>\n\n<p>Business leaders are taking notice:</p>\n\n<h2>What the data says on tool &amp; consolidation trends</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lsvp.com/cyber60-2024-2025/\">50% of CISOs</a> want to consolidate their security tools</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/06/02/new-global-business-research-security-sprawl-increases-risk\">65% of orgs</a> say they have too many security tools, and over half (53%) say their tools can\u2019t be integrated.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-09-12-gartner-survey-shows-seventy-five-percent-of-organizations-are-pursuing-security-vendor-consolidation-in-2022\">75% of organizations</a> aim to reduce their number of security vendors</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-09-12-gartner-survey-shows-seventy-five-percent-of-organizations-are-pursuing-security-vendor-consolidation-in-2022\">65% say consolidation</a> would improve their overall risk posture</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The message is clear: It\u2019s time to shift from being reactive to a more unified, strategic approach to cybersecurity.</p>\n\n<h2>What is cybersecurity tool sprawl?</h2>\n\n<p>Cybersecurity tool sprawl is a situation where you have an unnecessary number of cybersecurity tools when fewer tools could still cover all of the organization's needs for cybersecurity tool features. Fewer tools means easier management and lower costs.</p>\n\n<h2>What is cybersecurity vendor sprawl?</h2>\n\n<p>Same idea. Cybersecurity vendor sprawl is a situation where you have an unnecessary number of cybersecurity vendors when fewer vendors and tools could still cover all of the organization's needs for cybersecurity tool features. More tools from fewer vendors means easier relationship management with vendors and potentially lower costs due to bundling deals.</p>\n\n<h2>What are the negative impacts of tool &amp; vendor sprawl?</h2>\n\n<p>The negative effects of tool and vendor sprawl on costs, productivity, and risk profiles are well documented. But sometimes business leaders don\u2019t understand the full breadth of their potential downsides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Overlapping functionality, unnecessary cost</strong></p>\n\n<p>Multiple tools that fulfill similar use cases are usually an unnecessary cost.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Detection is harder</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Vendor tools don\u2019t share data well, often resulting in missed opportunities to detect and correlate signals.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Too many tools, too many dashboards</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having to log into dozens of tools to analyze issues reduces productivity and increases the risk of missing vital alerts.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Higher integration workload</strong></p>\n\n<p>More tools mean more integration work \u2014 that is, assuming the tools support integration into a centralized dashboard.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Hard to debug and run audits (and run AI)</strong></p>\n\n<p>With more tools, it becomes harder to read and aggregate cybersecurity logs and other data into central locations for fast debugging and auditing, which means longer investigations and more lengthy, expensive audit cycles. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shadow IT creates more attack surfaces</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes tool sprawl is the result of shadow IT. This can sometimes open up more attack surfaces because those tools are not being used with company policies in mind. In a 2020 <a href=\"https://www.cisoplatform.com/profiles/blogs/gartner-predicts-30-of-breaches-due-to-shadow-it-by-2020\">report</a>, Gartner estimated that nearly one-third of all successful cyberattacks come from shadow IT infrastructure. With significant tool sprawl, you've created a virtual shadow IT regardless of whether it was done intentionally or not, because it's extremely hard to have enterprise security visibility over so many tools.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Alert fatigue</strong></p>\n\n<p>The more cybersecurity tools you have, the more alerts you\u2019ll likely get. Many tools are hard to fine-tune so that they don\u2019t produce a litany of false positives.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Too many vendors to potentially contact for support</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vendor sprawl means there are a multitude of vendors to track down and collaborate with when your inevitable support needs arise. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Worse sales deals</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you are buying lots of tools, budgeting and procurement becomes more complex and there are fewer opportunities for volume discounts.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Lost synergy gains</strong></p>\n\n<p>A DIY, custom-integrated cybersecurity toolchain requires more maintenance, and organizations miss out on many of the synergy gains that come from using a suite of tools that work together as a platform out of the box.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Slower incident response</strong></p>\n\n<p>As the number of cybersecurity tools, tests, and interfaces grows, it takes longer to update security policies, implement patches consistently across all environments, and complete threat analyses.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>More maintenance costs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aside from integration maintenance, more tools also mean more maintenance in general. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to start your cybersecurity consolidation initiative</h2>\n\n<p>Tool sprawl is a growing problem, but it\u2019s also a solvable one. With the right strategy, organizations can reduce risk, streamline operations, and unlock real cost savings.</p>\n\n<p>Coming up in <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/how-to-start-consolidating-your-cybersecurity-tools\">part two of this blog</a>, we\u2019ll map out how to get started with cybersecurity toolchain rationalization and vendor consolidation, from aligning key teams to auditing your tooling landscape and identifying high-impact changes.  Stay tuned.</p>\n\n<h2>Real world case studies on consolidation</h2>\n\n<p>Organizational leaders must push their cybersecurity, engineering, and infrastructure operations teams to reduce complexity by centralizing and consolidating on a handful of security platforms rather than a litany of smaller cybersecurity tools.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/roche-s-transition-from-tools-to-platforms-with-terraform-and-vault\">Roche</a> and many other companies run successful cybersecurity product consolidation initiatives, and we\u2019d love to share more insights.

      "raw_content": "<p>Last night, Tesla made some hefty cuts to Cybertruck pricing in an effort to stimulate some sales. The bombastic tri-motor \"Cyberbeast\" is $15,000 cheaper at $99,990, albeit by dropping some previously free features like supercharging and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/10/tesla-fsd-gets-worse-at-driving-nhtsa-opens-new-investigation/\">FSD</a>. And there's now a new $59,990 entry-level model, a dual-motor configuration with a range of 325 miles (523 km) and the same 4.1-second 0\u201360 mph (0-97 km/h) time as the $79,990 premium all-wheel drive version.</p>\n<p>That actually makes the new entry-level model a good deal, at least in terms of Cybertrucks. Last year, the company <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a66102567/tesla-cybertruck-rear-wheel-drive-canceled/\">introduced and then eliminated</a> a single-motor rear-wheel drive variant, which found few takers when priced at $69,990; an extra motor for $10,000 less is quite a savings, and actually slightly cheaper than the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/the-cheapest-tesla-cybertruck-is-99990-promised-60k-model-canceled/\">price originally advertised for the RWD truck</a>.</p>\n<p>As you might expect, Tesla has made some changes to get down to the new price. The range and 0\u201360 mph time might be the same as the more expensive dual-motor Cybertruck, but towing capacity is reduced from 11,000 lbs (4,990 kg) to 7,000 lbs (3,175kg), and cargo capacity drops from 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) to 2,006 lbs (910 kg).</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/tesla-slashes-cybertruck-prices-as-it-tries-to-move-unpainted-metal/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/tesla-slashes-cybertruck-prices-as-it-tries-to-move-unpainted-metal/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",

The root cause wasn\u2019t just unethical behavior but a flawed approach to performance measurement. When Wells Fargo\u2019s leadership incentivized employees to sell eight financial products per customer, they inadvertently encouraged gaming behaviors that harmed customers, employees, and ultimately the bank itself. The metric had become more important than its underlying business purpose.</p>\n<p>Although Goodhart\u2019s law in action only sometimes rises to the level of scandal, companies everywhere fall prey to it: \u201cWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d Despite decades of warnings against metric fixation, leaders continue to build incentives around narrow indicators, which results in gaming and ethical lapses and harms business performance.</p>\n<p>Traditional solutions to overcoming Goodhart\u2019s \ufefflaw, like balanced scorecards and KPIs, often fail because they remain vulnerable to narrow optimization and gaming behaviors in the absence of careful oversight. The persistence of metric fixation signals a need for a more sophisticated approach to address the problem.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>A New Lens: Insights From AI Training</h3>\n<p>Leaders increasingly view organizations as systems to be optimized for specific outcomes, much as machine learning researchers optimize algorithms. Since both contexts involve optimizing proxy measures that can diverge from the true goals, solutions from AI research could help solve persistent organizational measurement problems. Of course, organizations consist of people with the agency and complex motivations that algorithms lack, so these techniques provide frameworks that require human adaptation, not mechanistic solutions.</p>\n<p>AI researchers have long studied a phenomenon called overfitting, where machine learning models perform well on training data but fail when faced with real-world scenarios because they can\u2019t generalize to predict outcomes with the new data.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consider a simple hypothetical example: An image recognition model tasked with distinguishing dogs from cats is trained on thousands of pet photos. During training, the system appears to perform flawlessly, correctly identifying every animal in the data. But when shown new photos in the real world, it fails dramatically. Why? The model didn\u2019t learn to recognize the essential features of dogs and cats; instead, it discovered incidental patterns in the training data. Perhaps the dog photos had grass backgrounds while cat photos were taken indoors. The system optimized for measurement (training accuracy), not the underlying goal (identifying real features).</p>\n<p>AI researchers recognize that optimizing too aggressively for proxy measures eventually undermines real-world outcomes. Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, a prominent AI researcher who has pioneered work in this area, has said that \u201cincreased efficiency can sometimes, counterintuitively, lead to worse outcomes,\u201d noting that this happens \u201calmost everywhere,\u201d whether in machine learning or organizational settings.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref1\" id=\"reflink1\">1</a> In machine learning, researchers observe that performance on a model\u2019s true objective follows a particular pattern: It initially improves as the model optimizes for the proxy measure, then plateaus, and eventually deteriorates dramatically as optimization intensifies. This demonstrates how the aggressive pursuit of metrics can destroy the very outcomes those metrics were intended to promote.</p>\n<p>\ufeffThe phenomenon occurs in organizations, too, when teams pursue metrics in ways that disconnect them from their strategic intent: Sales teams hit targets by pushing unwanted products, schools improve test scores by teaching to the test rather than building deeper understanding, or customer service representatives rush through calls to optimize for call-time metrics while sacrificing how completely they solve each customer\u2019s problems. Short-term wins on such metrics can hide or exacerbate deeper issues.</p>\n<p>Understanding how AI researchers avoid the problem of overfitting can help managers rethink how they design and track performance indicators to avoid gaming behaviors or narrow optimization and instead drive meaningful results.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Metric Intelligence Framework in Action</h3>\n<p>Machine learning has evolved four strategies to combat overfitting, each with direct implications for organizational design.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Early stopping: Prevent overoptimization through timely reassessment.</strong> Machine learning researchers discovered that continued training after a certain point harms a model\u2019s performance after it\u2019s fed new data. The solution is \ufeff<em>early stopping</em>, which entails monitoring performance on separate data and halting optimization when validation performance peaks, even if training performance could improve further.</p>\n<p>In a typical image recognition system, engineers might train the model on thousands of labeled images while regularly testing it on separate validation images. They may track the error rate on both sets and stop training when validation error starts to increase \u2014 a signal of overfitting \u2014 even if training error is still decreasing.</p>\n<p>Organizations can implement early stopping by regularly reassessing metrics against true objectives. Amazon implements this principle by periodically reviewing and adjusting its performance metrics. The company famously shifted its primary metric focus <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312505070440/dex991.htm\" target=\"_blank\">from profit margins to free cash flow per share</a> in 2004. This prevents teams from overoptimizing for any single metric and ensures alignment with changing business needs.</p>\n<p>Intel\u2019s experience in the late 1990s illustrates \ufeffthe process. The company had long emphasized processor clock speed as its primary performance metric and marketing focus. When auditing \ufeffthe metric, Intel discovered that continued optimization for speed was causing excessive power consumption, overheated chips, and diminishing returns in actual computing performance. This realization prompted Intel to shift toward a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2006/06/01/229027/intels-new-strategy-power-efficiency/\" target=\"_blank\">more balanced set of metrics</a> that included energy efficiency and overall computing capabilities \u2014 measurements that better aligned with customer value.</p>\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s shift to a more fluid goal-setting process exemplifies these same principles. When Satya Nadella became Microsoft\u2019s CEO in 2014, he devoted significant attention to helping the organization understand that metrics like revenue and profit were imperfect proxies for the company\u2019s broader mission.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref2\" id=\"reflink2\">2</a> This cultural shift away from metric fixation and toward an understanding of measurement limitations helped Microsoft employees make decisions that balanced quantitative targets with qualitative judgment. Instead of adhering to annual targets regardless of market changes, the company now conducts quarterly business reviews where teams can adjust their metrics and goals based on changing conditions and emerging data. \ufeffThe approach allows the organization to stop optimization for metrics that are becoming counterproductive.</p>\n<p>Another way to apply early stopping is by setting minimum targets rather than maximization goals. Unlike Wells Fargo\u2019s \u201ceight products per customer\u201d \u2014 which drove aggressive selling\u2014 true minimum targets establish a threshold of acceptable performance without rewards for exceeding it. For instance, a customer service department might set a minimum target of resolving 85% of inquiries within 24 hours. Once teams meet these minimum standards, they can focus on other dimensions of performance, preventing overfitting to any single metric.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent\">\n<aside class=\"l-content-wrap\">\n<article>\n<h4>Organizational Example: Sales Metrics Versus Customer Value</h4>\n<p class=\"caption\">Increasing performance on a single metric past an optimal point can harm other indicators of value.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Organizational Example: Sales Metrics Versus Customer Value\" src=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SP26_FE_Kovacs_1.png\" /></p>\n</article>\n</aside>\n</div>\n<p><strong>2. Noise \ufeffinjection: Build robustness \ufeffthrough \ufeffcontrolled \ufeffrandomness. </strong>AI systems benefit from deliberate randomness. When models rely too heavily on specific patterns, they memorize quirks rather than learning genuine relationships. As in our earlier example, if all dog photos in the training data have grass backgrounds, the model might learn \u201cgrass means dog\u201d rather than identifying actual canine features. To prevent such overfitting, some connections in the model are randomly turned off during training. Similarly, slightly altering training data, such as rotating images or adding background noise to audio, ensures that the AI learns meaningful patterns instead of irrelevant coincidences. This approach is known as noise injection.</p>\n<p>Organizations can apply noise injection in other contexts by conducting random audits, rotating team compositions, shuffling decision makers, or varying operational conditions. A sales team that always presents to the same manager might optimize for that person\u2019s preferences rather than customer value. By introducing controlled variability, organizations can prevent people from gaming predictable patterns.</p>\n<p>Financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase use random compliance audits that mirror AI\u2019s noise injection techniques. By making the timing of evaluations unpredictable, it discourages employees from developing workarounds or gaming behaviors that might emerge under predictable assessment schedules. The effectiveness of this approach is well documented in the IRS\u2019s random-audit program, where studies show each dollar invested in random audits generates up to $6 in additional revenue through deterrence effects.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref3\" id=\"reflink3\">3</a> Research has also found that randomly audited taxpayers maintain higher compliance for at least five years following an audit, with long-term benefits that exceed the immediate revenue recovered.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref4\" id=\"reflink4\">4</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implements this principle through its unannounced-inspection program for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Unlike scheduled audits, where facilities can temporarily optimize for evaluation day, surprise inspections prevent companies from hiding compliance issues. These random evaluations consistently reveal problems that would have been concealed during planned assessments, thus encouraging companies to maintain continuous compliance. These random evaluations proved so effective that the FDA expanded its unannounced-inspection program in 2025.</p>\n<p>Customer service organizations apply this principle when they use mystery shoppers who appear at unpredictable times, preventing retail staff members from providing excellent service only when they expect to be evaluated. Sales organizations might randomly audit customer interactions rather than focusing exclusively on closed deals, ensuring that representatives maintain ethical standards throughout the sales process. The Transportation Security Administration rotates screening personnel across different checkpoints and functions \u2014 baggage screening, metal detectors, document verification \u2014 to prevent security gaps that could emerge from predictable assignments. For instance, if the same guard always screened the same checkpoint, bad actors could study their screening patterns or even cultivate relationships with them to engage in social engineering. Random rotation ensures that no one can predict or influence who will be conducting their screening.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Capacity \ufeffalignment: Match \ufeffmetric \ufeffcomplexity to \ufefforganizational \ufeffcapabilities. </strong>Machine learning researchers match model complexity to their data and monitoring capabilities. This means that a team with millions of training examples and strong validation methods can safely deploy complex models with many parameters, whereas teams with limited data must use simpler models to avoid overfitting.</p>\n<p>Organizations should also match metric complexity with their oversight abilities. A company with advanced analytics infrastructure and skilled data scientists can implement complex, multidimensional metrics while maintaining integrity. Organizations with limited oversight capacity should stick to simpler, more robust metrics, even if they capture fewer nuances. The risk rises when metric complexity outpaces the quality of data and oversight. The same failure happens in machine learning: Overly complex models trained on limited data quickly collapse, especially when the same small validation set is used again and again.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref5\" id=\"reflink5\">5</a></p>\n<p>WeWork\u2019s \u201ccommunity adjusted EBITDA\u201d illustrates this dangerous middle ground. The company created a metric that excluded not just standard EBITDA adjustments but also basic operating expenses like marketing, administrative costs, and development spending. This metric was complex enough to obscure the company\u2019s financial position from investors who lacked the expertise to dissect it, yet it wasn\u2019t a sophisticated measure that captured real business performance. When the Securities and Exchange Commission intervened, requesting the metric\u2019s removal from WeWork\u2019s S-1 filing, the company attempted to rename it \u201ccontribution margin\u201d to satisfy regulators. By then, however, the metric had already helped attract billions in investment despite being meaningless for evaluating business health. WeWork\u2019s eventual bankruptcy proved that its business model was fundamentally flawed.</p>\n<p>Similar dynamics have played out in the financial sector. In the early 2010s, several major banks implemented sophisticated risk assessment metrics following the financial crisis, but many lacked the analytical infrastructure to properly validate those measures. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/imo/media/doc/REPORT%20-%20JPMorgan%20Chase%20Whale%20Trades%20(4-12-13).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading incident</a> in 2012 revealed this problem. The bank implemented a sophisticated Value-at-Risk model that proved to be fatally flawed, with spreadsheet errors that understated risk by 50%. The model\u2019s complexity allowed traders to game the system by manipulating price inputs within technically acceptable ranges, and risk managers lacked the analytical infrastructure to detect either the errors or the manipulation. This toxic combination of a sophisticated but broken model, deliberate gaming, and inadequate oversight capabilities resulted in over $6 billion in losses.</p>\n<p>Startups excel at alignment by focusing on simple metrics suited to their stage, such as customer acquisition cost, monthly recurring revenue, and retention rates. These are easy to track and directly tied to goals like product-market fit and cash flow. As businesses grow, metrics expand to include unit economics like lifetime value to acquisition cost, net revenue retention, cohort analysis, and service-level objectives. Large enterprises use more advanced analytics, tracking predictive customer health scores, experiment uplift, model performance and fairness in AI systems, and risk-adjusted ROI across portfolios. These are often integrated into balanced scorecards that connect financial, customer, and operational indicators.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-highlight\">\n<aside class=\"l-content-wrap\">\n<article>\n<h4>The Metric Distortion Test</h4>\n<p class=\"caption\">\n<p><strong>Is your organization vulnerable to metric fixation?

Regularization: Create \ufeffbalance \ufeffthrough \ufeffsimplicity \ufeffincentives. </strong>Regularization addresses a core problem in both AI and organizations: the tendency to optimize so effectively for a proxy measure that it actively harms the true goal leaders care about.</p>\n<p>In machine learning, regularization helps models avoid becoming overly specific, by penalizing excessive complexity. For instance, some methods penalize overly detailed rules, encouraging models to identify simpler, more general patterns. Without regularization, models become too tailored to training data and perform poorly when faced with new data. Organizations can implement this principle similarly: Adding constraints prevents the complex gaming behaviors that arise from excessive optimization. The constraints make gaming the system more complex and costly than performing well. Just as regularization forces AI models toward simpler patterns, organizational constraints make straightforward good performance simpler than elaborate gaming strategies.</p>\n<p>Amazon\u2019s approach to seller ratings illustrates this principle. Its algorithm can detect unusual patterns in customer feedback, such as sudden spikes in five-star reviews from accounts with a minimal purchase history or clusters of generic reviews posted within short time windows. Such patterns indicate that a seller has been soliciting positive reviews, which is prohibited and results in severe penalties. This constraint prevents sellers from gaming the review system and maintains alignment between the proxy measure (star ratings) and the true goal (seller quality). Without such constraints, sellers would find ways to inflate their ratings at the cost of real service quality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Netflix recognized that optimizing solely for \ufeffhours viewed\ufeff could incentivize the production of content that captures attention without providing value that retains subscribers. To prevent this distortion, Netflix implemented a multi-metric approach. As the <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report\" target=\"_blank\">company stated</a>, \u201cSuccess on Netflix comes in all shapes and sizes, and is not determined by hours viewed alone.\u201d In 2023, it switched to a \ufeffviews\ufeff metric (hours viewed divided by runtime), calling it \u201cour best measure of member satisfaction and a key driver of retention.\u201d By using multiple complementary metrics that balanced one another, Netflix created the organizational equivalent of regularization: preventing any single measurement from being gamed at the expense of true viewer satisfaction. This strategy has enabled the company to invest in diverse content with varying time horizons rather than focusing on immediate viewership metrics, supporting its long-term competitive position.</p>\n<p>Organizations can balance growth and efficiency through regularization by adding complexity penalties to highly optimized processes. After discovering that pure profit maximization was leading to environmental concerns, Unilever incorporated sustainability requirements as constraints on profit-seeking through its <a href=\"https://oxfordexecutive.co.uk/case-study-unilevers-sustainable-living-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Living Plan</a>. Instead of adding complexity, these requirements function as regularization terms that prevent extreme profit optimization by requiring balanced performance across multiple dimensions.</p>\n<p>Progressive compensation structures also serve as regularization tools. Whole Foods (before its acquisition by Amazon) implemented <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/before-amazon-deal-whole-foods-also-stood-for-moderate-executive-pay/\" target=\"_blank\">executive salary caps</a> tied to average worker compensation, creating a natural constraint against optimizing solely for leadership enrichment. Some organizations have found success with increased oversight mechanisms for teams that consistently exceed targets, triggering automatic reviews to verify that exceptional results aren\u2019t coming at the expense of unmeasured dimensions. Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s provides another example (notwithstanding recent turmoil at the company), with its <a href=\"https://benandjerrysfoundation.org/about/what-we-do/\" target=\"_blank\">required community engagement investments</a> tied to growth initiatives, ensuring that profit maximization remains balanced with social impact considerations.</p>\n<p>Regularization isn\u2019t about making things simpler. It\u2019s about setting constraints that keep optimization aligned with real goals. These constraints work best when they create balanced incentive structures that discourage extreme behaviors while still rewarding genuine improvement.</p>\n<p>By adapting these solutions, organizations can maintain the benefits of measurement while avoiding the pitfalls of metric fixation. Each strategy addresses a different aspect of the Goodhart\u2019s law problem, creating a framework for intelligent organizational metrics that drive performance without encouraging gaming behaviors.</p>\n<h3>The Future of Intelligent Measurement</h3>\n<p>The combination of artificial intelligence research and organizational design offers practical solutions to metric fixation. By applying techniques that keep AI models aligned with real-world goals, managers can improve how organizational performance is measured.</p>\n<p>These approaches must work in concert rather than isolation. Organizations adopting metric intelligence treat measurement as an ongoing practice requiring constant refinement, not a \ufeff\u201cset it and forget it\u201d solution. Successful implementations involve those who will be measured in designing the measurement system, resulting in both better metrics and greater buy-in for the new practices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Adopting this framework means overcoming hurdles familiar to both managers and AI developers. Leaders need to have patience and resist pressure for short-term results, just as AI teams hold off on deploying models \ufeffuntil they\u2019re fully trained and tested. Cultural resistance to new metrics parallels the trust issues with black-box algorithms, whose decisions can seem opaque. And success depends on integration: Metrics must connect across organizational silos, just as new algorithms must be woven into existing software and operations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, while these AI-inspired approaches improve measurement, they require careful human oversight. As Jerry Muller argues in his book <cite>The Tyranny of Metrics</cite>, not everything that matters can be quantified, and \u2014 given that organizations consist of individuals with complex motivations and behaviors \u2014 managerial judgment remains essential.<a class=\"reflink\" href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/feed/#ref6\" id=\"reflink6\">6</a> The ideal approach balances structure with flexibility, adding enough friction to prevent gaming without stifling initiative\ufeff and employing sufficient measures without drowning in data.</p>\n<p>This matters now because metrics are becoming more numerous and detailed. Without improved measurement strategies, organizations risk repeating past mistakes of narrow optimization. As AI agents increasingly take on direct roles within organizations, robust performance metrics become even more important. The insights from AI training won\u2019t just help managers measure human performance effectively; they will guide how goals are set and evaluated for AI workers.</p>\n<p></p>",

She had flagged Nick as an up-and-comer\u2014someone we should consider either for Sequoia itself or for one of our portfolio companies. She also introduced him to the CEO of a cybersecurity company we\u2019d partnered with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That CEO fell in love with Nick immediately and gave me explicit marching orders: \u201cYour mission is to help close Nick.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I happened to be spending a month in New York. Over a few Negronis, I got to know him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What stood out right away was Nick\u2019s intensity\u2014the hunger to achieve. As a McKinsey alum, I was especially impressed that he made engagement manager at the firm in just 18 months by, in his words, \u201chacking the system.\u201d McKinsey is famously time-based, but Nick figured out that early specialization\u2014becoming a true domain expert\u2014was the fastest way to short-circuit the ladder. His trampoline was legal tech, which also turned out to be the preamble to his founder story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, I was very much in pitch mode, trying to recruit him to our cybersecurity portfolio company. Nick\u2019s verdict: \u201cIf I were to take a job, this would be the one. But I really want to try my luck starting my own company.\u201d Fair enough, I thought. And of course, the next best thing to recruiting Nick into a portfolio company was partnering with him on his own entrepreneurial journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first question was simple: \u201cWhat will the company do?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Legal tech,&#8221; he replied. He told me he\u2019d spent his entire McKinsey career serving general counsels and overlooked mid-market in-house legal teams. Nick knew that AI could give these understaffed and overworked teams real leverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s where the serendipity kicked in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2019, before joining Sequoia, I had seriously considered starting a legal tech company myself. I had just left Google, and I was traveling the world, plotting my next move. The idea came from my time at VMware, where it had taken a team of 10 people to manually extract 62 key terms from licensing contracts. That stuck with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started calling GC friends in the Valley and quickly realized: <em>everyone</em> was doing some version of this. Spreadsheets as databases. Manual toil everywhere. The MVP became obvious\u2014use ML to extract key contract terms and populate a searchable system. This was pre-LLMs, but even then it felt doable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had I started that company, it could easily have evolved into Sandstone: an AI-native workflow engine for in-house legal teams. Sandstone learns from a company\u2019s legal intelligence to execute work and simplify business operations, transforming their roles from reactive to strategic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Sequoia, we often talk about the idea of a prepared mind\u2014doing the work on big market shifts before the opportunity shows up. In a sense, I\u2019d been preparing for Sandstone for years. Happily, so had Nick. When he told me his idea, I dusted off my 2019 Product Requirements Document and sent it to him. That may have sealed the deal. <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude42\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/17.0.2/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, legal tech hasn\u2019t been an easy market. But AI has fundamentally changed the dynamics. We\u2019re now seeing multiple legal AI companies scaling quickly, driven by two forces:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Law is the perfect LLM use case\u2014the profession is based on text in, text out.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AI is most powerful when it automates expensive human toil, and few professions rely so heavily on highly trained people doing repetitive work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Sandstone, Sequoia had already partnered with Harvey (AI lawyer), Crosby (AI-enabled law firm), and Ironclad (AI contracting and contract lifecycle management), so we\u2019d seen these dynamics play out firsthand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two months after meeting Nick, we led Sandstone\u2019s pre-seed. Along the way, we got to know his co-founder Jarryd Strydom\u2014another McKinsey alum, and a rare combination of attorney and builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick and Jarryd accelerated from a standing start. They built the MVP in weeks, put it in front of customers immediately, and recruited an outstanding founding team that matches their intensity. The energy in their Brooklyn office is palpable, and it comes from the top. One of my favorite anecdotes: after a dinner together in NYC, we wrapped around 11pm\u2014and both Nick and Jarryd went straight back to the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That speed and execution gave us the conviction to double down and lead Sandstone\u2019s seed round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is just the beginning. Sandstone is well on its way to transforming how legal teams operate and how business gets done.</p>\n</section>\n\n\n<section class=\"social-sharing\">\n\t<div class=\"social-sharing__container\">\n\t\t<h2 class=\"social-sharing__title caption caption--16\">Share</h2>\n\t\t<div class=\"social-sharing__options\">\n\t\t\t<button class=\"ico--facebook\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\">\n\t\t\t\tShare this on Facebook\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</button>\n\t\t\t<button class=\"ico--twitter\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\">\n\t\t\t\tShare this on Twitter\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</button>\n\t\t\t<button class=\"ico--linkedin\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\">\n\t\t\t\tShare this on LinkedIn\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</button>\n\t\t\t<a class=\"ico--email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Partnering+with+Sandstone:+An+AI-Native+Platform+for+In-House+Legal+Teams&#038;body=https%3A%2F%2Fsequoiacap.com%2Farticle%2Fpartnering-with-sandstone-an-ai-native-platform-for-in-house-legal-teams%2F\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"sr-only\">Share this via email</span>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n<div class=\"tags grid\">\n\t<div class=\"grid__instances\">\n\t\t<div class=\"grid__instance\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"tags__container grid__content\">\n\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"tags__title caption caption--16\">Related Topics</h2>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"tags__links l-pillbox l-pillbox--centered\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"tag\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/tag/ai/\" style=\"background-color: #fab23a;\">\n\t<span class=\"tag__name tag__name--dark\">#AI</span>\n</a>\n<a class=\"tag\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/tag/funding-announcement/\" style=\"background-color: #fab23a;\">\n\t<span class=\"tag__name tag__name--dark\">#Funding announcement</span>\n</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"grid\">\n\t<div class=\"grid__instances\">\n\t<div class=\"grid__instance\"><div class=\"grid__content\"><a class=\"ink\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-traversal-because-every-engineer-remembers-their-first-time-troubleshooting/?itm_medium=related-content&#038;itm_source=sequoiacap.com\" style=\"background-color: #1b1916;\"><div class=\"ink__content\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"ink__image\" height=\"880\" src=\"https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/06/Ink_Traversal.jpg?w=880&amp;h=880&amp;crop=1\" width=\"880\" />\t<div class=\"ink__text\">\n\t\t\n<h2 class=\"ink__title\">Partnering with Traversal</h2>\n\n\t<div class=\"ink__detail\">By Bogomil Balkansky and Charlie Curnin</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__category ink__category--news\">News</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__cta\">Read</div>\n\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</a></div></div><div class=\"grid__instance\"><div class=\"grid__content\"><a class=\"ink\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-fastapi-labs-simplified-app-deployment/?itm_medium=related-content&#038;itm_source=sequoiacap.com\" style=\"background-color: #1b1916;\"><div class=\"ink__content\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"ink__image\" height=\"880\" src=\"https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/05/Fast-API-Labs_Ink.jpg?w=880&amp;h=880&amp;crop=1\" width=\"880\" />\t<div class=\"ink__text\">\n\t\t\n<h2 class=\"ink__title\">Partnering with FastAPI Labs: Simplified App Deployment </h2>\n\n\t<div class=\"ink__detail\">By Bogomil Balkansky and Lauren Reeder</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__category ink__category--news\">News</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__cta\">Read</div>\n\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</a></div></div><div class=\"grid__instance\"><div class=\"grid__content\"><a class=\"ink\" href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-apex-security-the-ai-empowered-future-secured/?itm_medium=related-content&#038;itm_source=sequoiacap.com\" style=\"background-color: #1b1916;\"><div class=\"ink__content\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"ink__image\" height=\"880\" src=\"https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Ink_Apex-Portrait.jpg?w=880&amp;h=880&amp;crop=1\" width=\"880\" />\t<div class=\"ink__text\">\n\t\t\n<h2 class=\"ink__title\">Partnering with Apex Security: The AI-Empowered Future, Secured</h2>\n\n\t<div class=\"ink__detail\">By Bogomil Balkansky</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__category ink__category--news\">News</div>\n\n<div class=\"ink__cta\">Read</div>\n\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</a></div></div>\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<section class=\"wide-signup grid\">\n\t<div class=\"grid__instances\">\n\t\t<div class=\"grid__instance\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"grid__content grid__content--dark\" style=\"background-color: transparent;\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wide-signup__container\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wide-signup__intro\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJOIN OUR MAILING LIST\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1 class=\"wide-signup__title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet the best stories from the Sequoia community.\t\t\t\t\t</h1>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wide-signup__form\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<!-- Mailchimp for WordPress v4.10.9 -

U.S. businesses alone spend <a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry/business-insurance/4779/\">hundreds of billions</a> on it each year, yet the details go unnoticed. Coverage is understood as \u201cthe cost of doing business\u201d while many companies go without the protection they actually need. In a market that still runs on emails and PDFs, customers have nonetheless come to expect that their premiums will increase every year. And business owners also accept, or simply don\u2019t know, that commissions\u2014often as high as 30%\u2014incentivize brokers to sell them expensive policies that too often don\u2019t actually mitigate the risks they face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very largest companies, such as the Fortune 2000, have in-house risk managers to oversee insurance. But most other businesses must rely on traditional brokers. These legacy providers\u2019 high costs and manual operations prevent personalized assessments from specialists who deeply understand a business\u2019s operations, while perverse incentives align the brokers\u2019 interests with insurers\u2019, not customers\u2019. Rather than delivering the best client experience, insurance producers are focused primarily on growing their book of business; as a result, customers are simultaneously overcharged and underinsured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With AI, however, all of that can change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://withcoverage.com/\">WithCoverage</a> co-founders JD Ross and Max Brenner are supercharging risk management by pairing industry experts with technology. JD and Max believe comprehensive risk audits shouldn\u2019t be reserved for the world\u2019s biggest companies\u2014they think that\u2019s how insurance should work for everyone. WithCoverage\u2019s AI audit engine helps their team analyze a business\u2019s policies and operations to spot what brokers miss, so they can deliver a line-by-line breakdown of potential savings and risks on a customer\u2019s first call. Meanwhile, countless emails and PDFs are replaced by a simple, digital platform and a unified team. Hidden commissions are replaced by transparent fees. One convert told us, \u201cI had no intention of changing brokers, but they blew us away.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we at Sequoia talked to the teams that use WithCoverage, we heard the same effusive customer love again and again. \u201cThe best claims call we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d \u201cYour team will actually thank you.\u201d \u201cInstead of taking you golfing, they will actually save you money on insurance.\u201d And then there were the bottom lines: saving customers up to 30% on their total insurance budget, representing up to seven figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The customers aren\u2019t the only ones suddenly paying more attention to insurance. JD and Max understand that building applied AI is about capturing nuance\u2014automating countless tiny decisions, in the right order, to deliver for their customers\u2014and that is exactly how WithCoverage operates. Product and Engineering teams sit side-by-side with risk specialists, working together to design what customers truly need. For anyone interested in breaking the scaling laws of a massive market, it is the <a href=\"https://withcoverage.com/careers\">perfect place</a> to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better, WithCoverage is led by two exceptional founders. While at Washington University, JD founded and scaled two businesses, joined the fintech company Addepar as its fifth employee when he was just 19, and still graduated in three years. A few years later, he and Keith Rabois (our co-lead in WithCoverage\u2019s Series B) joined forces with Eric and Ian to co-found Opendoor. Max, meanwhile, scaled Compound to its first $1B in AUM as part of the founding team. Applying software to financial advice reshaped his view of why legacy advisory businesses stagnate\u2014and where they can be rebuilt from first principles. After leaving, he was intent on starting a generational business. When a friend introduced JD and Max over lunch, they knew immediately that they wanted to work together. They are true outliers, and they have the velocity and grit to go the distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hundreds of companies across sectors have already switched to WithCoverage, and word is spreading fast. JD, Max, and the team are quickly expanding into new verticals, from construction to aerospace\u2014and in response to customer demand, plan to grow beyond insurance, as well. We at Sequoia are proud to be by their side as they work to fully modernize risk management and to bring insurance on-side for businesses.</p>\n</section>\n\n\n<section

Who knows what kind of naughty digital mischief they might be up to?</p><p>Unfortunately, we now live in a world where this kind of digital mischief is literally rewriting the world&#x2019;s history. For proof of that, you need look no further than this single email that was sent March 19th, 2016.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-hack-email-text.png\" width=\"613\" /></figure><p>If you don&#x2019;t recognize what this is, it is a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/phishing-the-forever-hack/\">phishing email</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-31.png\" width=\"1092\" /></figure><p>This is by now a very, very famous phishing email, arguably the most famous of all time. But let&#x2019;s consider&#xa0;how this email even got sent to its target in the first place:</p><ul><li>An attacker slurped up lists of any public emails of 2008 political campaign staffers.</li><li>One 2008 staffer was&#xa0;<em>also</em>&#xa0;hired for the 2016 political campaign.</li><li>That particular staffer had non-public campaign emails in their address book, and one of them was a powerful key campaign member with an extensive email history.</li></ul><p>On successful phish leads to an even wider address book attack net down the line. Once they gain access to a person&#x2019;s inbox, they use it to prepare to their next attack. They&#x2019;ll harvest existing email addresses, subject lines, content, and attachments to construct plausible looking boobytrapped emails and mail them to all of&#xa0;<em>their</em>&#xa0;contacts. How sophisticated and targeted to a particular person this effort is determines whether it&#x2019;s so-called &#x201c;spear&#x201d; phishing or not.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"742\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/phishing-vs-spear-phishing.png\" width=\"1972\" /></figure><p>In this case is it was not at all targeted. This is a remarkably unsophisticated, absolutely generic routine phishing attack. There is zero focused attack effort on display here. But note the target did&#xa0;<em>not</em>&#xa0;immediately click the link in the email!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"989\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-hack-email-link-1.png\" width=\"1696\" /></figure><p>Instead, he did exactly what you&#x2019;d want a person to do in this scenario:&#xa0;<strong>he emailed IT support and asked if this email was valid.</strong>&#xa0;But IT made&#xa0;a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fatal mistake in their response</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"610\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/podesta-it-support-response.png\" width=\"1212\" /></figure><p>Do you see it? Here&#x2019;s the kicker:</p><blockquote>Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said&#xa0;<strong>he had meant to type that it was an &#x201c;illegitimate&#x201d; email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.</strong></blockquote><p>One word. He got&#xa0;<em>one</em>&#xa0;word wrong. But what a word to get wrong, and in the first sentence! The email did provide the proper Google address to reset your password. But the lede was already buried since the first sentence said &#x201c;legitimate;&#x201d; the phishing link in that email was then clicked. And the rest is literally history.</p><p>What&#x2019;s even funnier (well, in the way of gallows humor, I guess) is that public stats were left enabled for that bit.ly tracking link, so you can see exactly what crazy domain that &#x201c;Google login page&#x201d; resolved to, and that it was clicked exactly twice, on the same day it was mailed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"715\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/bitly-podesta-tracking-link.png\" width=\"1120\" /></figure><p>As I said, these were not exactly sophisticated attackers. So yeah, in&#xa0;<em>theory</em>&#xa0;an attentive user could pay attention to the browser&#x2019;s address bar and notice that after clicking the link, they arrived at</p><p><code>http://myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk/security/signinoptions/password</code></p><p>instead of</p><p><code>https://myaccount.google.com/security</code></p><p>Note that the phishing URL is carefully constructed so the most &#x201c;correct&#x201d; part is at the front, and weirdness is sandwiched in the middle. Unless you&#x2019;re paying very close attention and your address bar is long enough to expose the full URL, it&#x2019;s&#x2026; tricky. See this 10 second video for a dramatic example.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular\">\n            <div class=\"kg-video-container\">\n                <video height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://img.spacergif.org/v1/1920x1080/0a/spacer.png\" preload=\"metadata\" src=\"https://storage.ghost.io/c/eb/aa/ebaa2665-01a8-4415-8825-69d1f0e8fd19/content/media/2025/02/twitter-phishing-video.mp4\" width=\"1920\"></video>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-overlay\">\n                    <button class=\"kg-video-large-play-icon\">\n                        <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                            <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\">\n                        </svg>\n                    </button>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-player-container\">\n                    <div class=\"kg-video-player\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-play-icon\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                                <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                                <rect height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\" width=\"7\" x=\"3\" y=\"1\">\n                                <rect height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\" width=\"7\" x=\"14\" y=\"1\">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <span class=\"kg-video-current-time\">0:00</span>\n                        <div class=\"kg-video-time\">\n                            /<span class=\"kg-video-duration\">0:10</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <input class=\"kg-video-seek-slider\" max=\"100\" type=\"range\" value=\"0\" />\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-playback-rate\">1&#xd7;</button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-unmute-icon\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                                <path d=\"M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z\">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                                <path d=\"M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z\">\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <input class=\"kg-video-volume-slider\" max=\"100\" type=\"range\" value=\"100\" />\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n        </figure><p>(<s>And if you think that one&#x2019;s good, check out&#xa0;this one.</s> Don&#x2019;t forget all the Unicode look-alike trickery you can pull, too.) </p><p>I originally wrote this post as a presentation for the Berkeley Computer Science Club back in March, and at that time I gathered a list of public phishing pages I found on the web.</p><p><code>nightlifesofl.com<br />ehizaza-limited.com<br />tcgoogle.com<br />appsgoogie.com<br />security-facabook.com</code></p><p>Of those five examples from 6 months ago, one is completely gone, one loads just fine, and three present an appropriately scary red interstitial warning page that strongly advises you not to visit the page you&#x2019;re trying to visit, courtesy of Google&#x2019;s&#xa0;<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">safe browsing API</a>.

Most messages were deleted after 30 days and staff went through phishing drills. Security awareness even followed the campaigners into the bathroom, where someone put a picture of a toothbrush under the words: &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t share your passwords either.&#x201d;</blockquote><p>The campaign itself used two factor auth extensively, which is why personal Gmail accounts were targeted, because they were less protected.</p><p>The key takeaway here is that&#xa0;<strong>it&#x2019;s basically impossible, statistically speaking, to prevent your organization from being phished.</strong></p><p>Or is it?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/02/image-32.png\" width=\"440\" /></figure><p>Nobody is doing better work in this space right now than Maciej Ceglowski and Tech Solidarity.

These three short sentences are the 60 second summary of what you want to do, and what you want to share with others so&#xa0;<em>they</em>&#xa0;do, too.</p><p><strong>1) Enable Two Factor authentication through an app, and&#xa0;<em>not SMS</em>, everywhere you can.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"481\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/google-2fa-1.png\" width=\"566\" /></figure><p>Logging in with only a password, now matter how long and unique you attempt to make that password, will never be enough. A password is what you know; you need to add the second factor of something you&#xa0;<em>have</em>&#xa0;(or something you&#xa0;<em>are</em>) to achieve significant additional security. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SMS can famously&#xa0;be intercepted</a>, social engineered, or sim-jacked all too easily. If it&#x2019;s SMS, it&#x2019;s not secure,&#xa0;<em>period</em>. So install an authenticator app, and use it, at least for your most important credentials such as your email account and your bank.</p><p>Have I mentioned that Discourse&#xa0;added <a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2018/05/discourse-2-0-released/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two factor authentication support</a> in version 2.0, and our just released 2.1 adds printed backup codes, too? There are two paths forward: you can&#xa0;<em>talk</em>&#xa0;about the solution, or you can&#xa0;<em>build</em>&#xa0;the solution. I&#x2019;m trying to do both to the best of my ability. Look for the 2FA auth option in your user preferences on your favorite Discourse instance. It&#x2019;s there for you.</p><p>(This is also a company policy at Discourse; if you work here,&#xa0;<em>you 2FA everything all the time</em>. No other login option exists.)</p><p><strong>2) Make all your passwords 11 characters or more.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/hacker-hack-thyself/\">a long story</a>, but anything under 11 characters&#xa0;is basically the <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-password-is-too-damn-short/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">same as having no password</a> at all&#xa0;these days. I personally recommend at least 14 characters, maybe even 16. But this won&#x2019;t be a problem for you, because...</p><p><strong>3) Use a password manager.</strong></p><p>If you use a password manager, you can simultaneously avoid the pernicious danger of password re-use and&#xa0;the difficulty of coming up with <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/\">unique and random passwords</a>&#xa0;all the time. It is my hope in the long run that cloud based password management gets deeply built into Android, iOS, OSX, and Windows so that people don&#x2019;t need to run a weird m&#xe9;lange of third party apps to achieve this essential task. Password management is foundational and should not be the province of third parties on principle, because you never outsource a core competency.</p><p><strong>Bonus rule! For the particularly at-risk, get and use a U2F key.</strong></p><p>In the long term, two factor through an app isn&#x2019;t quite secure enough due to the very real (and growing) specter of real-time phishing. Authentication apps offer timed keys that expire after a minute or two, but if the attacker can get you to type an authentication key and relay it to the target site fast enough, they can still log in as you. If you need ultimate protection,&#xa0;look into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U2F keys</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"There is no longer any such thing as Computer Security\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2018/09/u2f-keys.jpg\" width=\"720\" /></figure><p>I believe U2F support is still too immature at the moment, particularly on mobile, for this to be practical for the average person right now. But if you do happen to fall into those groups that will be under attack, you&#xa0;<em>absolutely</em>&#xa0;want to set up U2F keys where you can today. They&#x2019;re cheap, and the good news is that they&#xa0;<em>literally make phishing impossible</em>&#xa0;at last. Given that Google had&#xa0;100% company-wide <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">success against phishing with U2F</a>, we know this works.</p><p>In today&#x2019;s world, computers are now so omnipresent that there is no longer any such thing as cybersecurity, online security, or computer security &#x2013; there&#x2019;s only&#xa0;<em>security</em>. You either have it, or you don&#x2019;t. If you follow and share these three rules, hopefully you too can have a modicum of security today.</p>",
